Pre flight
Auto A/D cal not functioning, but there are no analog channels.
Both Pdumps reading low around 583mb on the ground. No pumps running especially on the right side.


BO 1423
TO 1427

1433 looks like not getting data from IRS 3
1453 IRS3 is okay, there were some extra variables in the header.

1906 DPR balanace number seems high at 3000+
1931 DPR is working much beter than DPL in the desent.
I would say dewpointers are okay. but really ugly in the desent.

Tech: Kyle

Takeoff: 14:24
Landing: 21:34

I noticed at 18:00 that the timeserver's Ref Time LED was red. The Novatel is seeing 22 sats, ggqual is 5(Good), and ggstatus(rcvr) is 1(OK).  Checked all connections with no success. I was able to login to it's web browser interface.  Says it's seeing 16 satellites but they are no good. At 19:54, I noticed it came back with good satellites. All green LED's now.
