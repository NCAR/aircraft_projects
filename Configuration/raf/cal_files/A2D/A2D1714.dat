#  A2D Calibration for Board with serial number 1710
#  Since these calibrations are for boards with 8 channels available, there is a linear calibration for each channel.
#  Additionally, since each channel can support a variety of voltage ranges, each line represents one voltage range.  These ranges are defined by the Gain/Bipolar combination as follows:
#  Gain	 Bipolar 	VoltageRange
#  ----  ------         -------------
#   1      1		-10 to 10 V
#   2	   0		  0 to 10 V
#   2	   1		 -5 to  5 V
#   4	   0		  0 to  5 V
#
#   A2D calibrations are performed in a temperature chamber that is set to 40 degrees Celcius.  This facilitates a temperature based correction (currently appplied only to 0-5 V range)
#   Further, these calibrations are generally done for all channels and for all 4 voltage ranges.
