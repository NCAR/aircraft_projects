# temperature: nan  - it is reasonably safe to asume that these cals were taken at 40 Degrees C - a bug
# in the calibration tool is generating NaNs.
#   The following cals were taken April 17, 2012 but were exported to cal file on Sep 14, 2012 thus the
#   date info.  Additionally a poly cal was taken for Channel 2 on the 1T cal and for channel 5 on the
#   4F cal and thus were replaced with calibrations from above.
