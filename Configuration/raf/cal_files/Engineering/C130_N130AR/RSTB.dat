# The curve fits tended to be second order in the past when we did the cals in-house because the blackbody wasn't very
# stable at cold temperatures. Now that we are sending them out to be calibrated with a better system, the sensors 
# respond linearly as they should. nimbus can't handle both linear and poly for a single cal file, so include a zero 
# 3rd term.
