#   Pre-VOCALS cals adjusted by Tom B. to move them to 40 Degrees C since that is the reference temperature used in the temperature corrected A2D calibration software
#     These values were determined based on a formula created by W. "Al" Cooper that says:
#                         Sr = Sc/[1 - Sc*0.00033(Tc-Tr)] 
#                         Or = Oc/[1 - Sc*0.00033(Tc-Tr)]
#   Where Sr is the 40 degree corrected calibration slope (reference), Sc is the calibration slope determined in the lab, Tc is the a2d temperature (deg C) at the time the calibration was taken 
#         in the lab, and Tr is the reference temperature (40 Degrees C), Or is the 40 degree corrected calibration offset and Oc is the offset determined in the lab
#   so the following Calibrations were calculated using that approach.
#   The date was selected to be prior to the HIPPO3 project - i.e. Mar 1 2010 - then the old cals for after HIPPO3 project i.e. Apr 1 2010

#  Newly updated to use Chris's 40 degree chamber calibration done 18 May 2010 - 
#    - note only channels 0-3 have the 40 degree chamber value, other channels use adjusted as above comments.
