# The following adjustments are made according to the Rsig agreement determined to compensate for an
#   offset in the A2D board during the CONTRAST project.  The algorithm is as follows:
#   (a) For flights before 6: no adjustment
#   (b) For flights 6-12: adjust by -0.7503 Deg_C * (flight number - 5) / 8
#   (c) For flights 13 and beyond: adjust by -0.7503 Deg_C
