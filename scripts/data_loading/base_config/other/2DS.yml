  title: Fast 2D-S -- ICARTT format
  archive_ident: <2DS>
  summary: >
    A 2D-S instrument is a cloud particle probe that contains two orthogonal open path optical array probes,
    which image cloud particles between about 10 microns - 2 mm in size as they pass through the instrument sample volume.  
    This imagery is used to calculate the concentration and cross-sectional area size distributions, and to estimate the mass
    size distribution of the observed cloud particles.  These variables are integrated across the size bins to obtain the total concentration,
    extinction, and estimated total water content over the observed size range, and is provided at a frequency of 1 Hz.  
    The particle imagery can be utilized to infer cloud particle phase.  This data does not cover the full size range of cloud particles, 
    and should be analyzed in conjunction with complementary cloud probes, such as the CDP, HVPS, etc.  
    This dataset contains Fast 2D-S imagery collected aboard the NCAR <AIRCRAFT> during the <PROJECT> project.

  title: NSF/NCAR GV (HIAPER) Raw 2D-S Imagery (RAF OAP .2d format)
  archive_ident: <2DS_rafoap>
  summary: >
    A 2D-S instrument contains two 2D probes which image particles as they pass through beams that are oriented orthogonally to each other and 
    the airflow. If particles also lie in the intersection of the sensitive areas of the two beams, they are seen by both 2D probes. This dataset 
    contains 2D-S imagery collected aboard the NCAR <AIRCRAFT> during the <PROJECT> project using the SPEC 2D-S (Stereo) probe. The 
    original files have been processed so that they are compatible with xpms2d software.
