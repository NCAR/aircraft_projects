  summary: |
    During <PROJECT>, the NSF/NCAR <aircraft> (Tail Number <tailnumber>) flew digital cameras for in-flight video capture. Individual photo jpeg images were captured once per second during flights. Images taken after dark have been stripped from this archive. Remaining forward and downward images for each second were combined into a single image and processed to include production data along the right side of the image and converted to Quicktime movie files. The movies are h.264 codec playable with Quicktime (Mac and Windows), xine, (linux) and mplayer (many platforms). The original images are 1024x768 pixels and were recorded at 1 frame/second. The movies are set to play back at 512x384 pixels and 15 fps.
    Animated plots are visible on the right side of the frame with the following variables:
    Plot 1: GGALT timeseries  
    Plot 2: PSX timeseries   
    Plot 3: ATX timeseries 
    Plot 4: DPXC timeseries
    Plot 5: WIC timeseries
    Plot 6: PLWCC timeseries  
    Plot 7: CONCS_2DS timeseries  
    Plot 8: CONCD_LWI timeseries
    Plot 9: FO3C_ACD timeseries
    Plot 10: (ATX, DPXC), GGALT 1:1  
    Plot 11: GGLAT, GGLON 1:1
