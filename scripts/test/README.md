# README describing how to run tests within this /test directory.

#These files are tests for the push_data.py program located one directory up. 
#
#In order to run these tests, you will need to change the path in the __init__.py file
#
#from sys.path.append('/scr/tmp/taylort/aircraft_projects/scripts/') to wherever your local checkout is.
#
#Then, from the scripts directory (not the /test directory), you should execute the following:

#"python -m unittest discover -s test -v"
