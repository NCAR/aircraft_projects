Dear all,

Quite a few people on the START-08 team are involved in HEFT-08 as well, so 
I am including you on this message.

I have developed a tentative schedule for the instrumentation upload and 
integration, which is available here:

http://www.eol.ucar.edu/deployment/field-deployments/field-projects/HEFT-08-project

Note that activities in December are not scheduled but are penciled in 
pending aircraft and personnel avilability.
Please let me know if you have conflicting schedules and I will try to 
accommodate them if possible.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear instrument teams:

I would like to clarify the certification documentation deadlines.

For instruments participating in HEFT08, which are NO-NOy, Fast-O3 and AWAS 
the documentation for certification needs to be at RAF by December 15. If 
you have it earlier please send it in so that Mark and Kurt can go through 
it in stages rather than getting it all on the 15th in one big pile.

For all other instruments (not participating in HEFT08) the documentation 
needs to be at RAF by February 1. Again, earlier is better and will allow 
for feedback from Mark and Kurt in case changes or additions are needed for 
documentation.

One month to three weeks prior to the first flights (for both HEFT and 
START) there will be a final cutoff date after which modifications to the 
documentation will not be accepted. This timeline depends on the schedule of 
the meeting with the FAA officials where the final documentation is 
approved.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

It appears that there are no hard conflicts with the proposed schedule for 
the upload, so from now on we will consider it the current working plan:

Dear HEFT / GIMOS participants,

The HEFT / GISMOS upload is progressing and we are behind schedule at this 
point. However, considering that we still have the week of 27 January that 
initially was scheduled for instrumentation check-out, we are still palnning 
to perform first flight on the week of 4 February, which is on schedule.

I suggest that we have a short meeting at Jeffco with a telecon for the 
instrument PIs on February 1 at 1 pm MST to talk about what people want to 
do for the test flights. We expect TF01 to be a simple flight with a couple 
of level legs going to maximum altitude, probably heading NW into Wyoming. 
If you have ideas or needs, please send them in or voice them at the 
meeting. (Dial 1-800-516-9896 and use code 3034978892# to join).

At this time we are planning to weigh the airplane on February 4, conduct 
the EMI test on February 5 (all instruments On) and attempt a 2-2.5 hour 
test flight on February 6 or 7. We will hold a safety briefing on 4 February 
while the airplane is being weighed; the meeting is mandatory for people who 
plan to fly on the GV, so please plan to participate. If you can not make it 
we will provide an additional briefing for you before you can fly on the GV 
for HEFT. (For people participating in START later this spring, you will 
need to attend the safety briefing again. We need the signed documents for 
every project).

The test flight(s) will be part of HEFT flight hours, not GISMOS. After TF01 
we will assess the status and are open to another test flight before moving 
on to the GISMOS series of flights (40 flight hours, likely 6 flights). I 
will post a possible GISMOS flight schedule shortly to pave a road for 
further discussion.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

We will conduct the HEFT-08 safety briefing on Monday, 4 February, at 10:30 
AM in the Jeffco conference room. Everyone who will fly on the GV is 
required to attend. If you can not attend at this time we will try to 
accommodate you but may not be able to schedule a briefing prior to the 
first test flight (possible on Wednesday; more likely on Thursday).

The airplane will be weighed during the briefing and no access would be 
possible anyway.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

Please review the tentative operations schedule. It may change as we 
progress, depending on instruments issues and of course on the weather, and 
we may extend into the last week of February but only if the weather 
prevents us from completing the GISMOS flights in time.

It is possible to fly three TF prior to launching GISMOS if needed.

We also want to keep weekend operations to the absolute minimum unless there 
are pressing instrumentation issues because we do not have an allocation for 
overtime for HEFT.

Dear all,

We planned for an EMI test on the GV today but are experiencing a delay with 
wing DSMs. I was informed that a working DSM is being delivered to RAF at 11 
am and we should have functional DSMs after lunch time. If we do not have 
DSMs installed and connected at 2 pm, we will call off the EMI test for 
today and will try again tomorrow. There is no plan for extending into 
overtime to finish up the preparations.

If we do manage to get it all together by 2 pm, we will roll out shortly 
after that.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

The GV EMI test was successful this afternoon. A couple of minor issues were 
identified and will be looked into but we are good to go from that 
perspective.

Wednesday will be a maintenance day. This is the time to tidy up the cabin 
and finalize the wiring in the cabin in preparation for flights. There is a 
chance of a test flight on Thursday; I will ask people for a status update 
tomorrow afternoon and with that we will decide on flight readiness and the 
takeoff time (provided we receive the FAA clearance).

On Wednesday we will also hold a Flight Readiness Review (FRR). In 
preparation for it, the GV Chief of Maintenance will walk around the cabin 
in the morning and help the PIs identify areas that require attention prior 
to declaring the research system flight worthy. Then at 2 pm a formal 
inspection will be conducted, followed by a brief RAF FRR (no need for 
science teams to participate). Depending on the results of the inspection 
the payload will be either declared flight ready or areas requiring 
additional work will be identified.

I will start updating the 303-497-1040 hotline (dial and wait for the 
message) starting today. If you need immediate assistance, please call me on 
the project cell number at 303-345-3173.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

The plan for tomorrow, Thursday 2/7/2008 - maintenance day. Please take your 
time to make sure the instruments are ready to fly, and the RAF will use 
this time to conduct flight readiness inspections and obtain final approvals 
from the FAA.

We would like to conduct the first test flight on Friday. Current forecast 
is for very high winds, so this may not be possible. Check the hotline 
tomorrow for an update on the flight and possible takeoff time.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

The airplane has been inspected today and we can now proceed with flight 
operations.

The plan for Friday, 2/8/2008 is to attempt a test flight. We will assess 
the weather situation at 8 am and if the winds are not excessive, roll out 
at 8 am for a 10 am takeoff. Estimated flight duration - under two hours. 
The plan is to fly NW from Jeffco, climbing to max altitude, while testing 
the satcom system on a heading similar to the one that caused problems for 
the C-130 in ICE-L. In about 30 min the GV will head east and descend over 
Lake McConaughy for low altitude passes for GISMOS calibrations. After this 
is done we will climb to approximately FL180 heading east to test the 
dropsonde system, then return to Jeffco.

If the wind is too strong in the morning, we will delay the flight, possibly 
into early afternoon. The forecast calls for decreasing winds during the 
day.

There is no operations or maintenance planned for the weekend. If we are 
unable to fly tomorrow we will hold a brief meeting to decide on what to do 
next.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

The first test flight of HEFT/GISMOS went very well today. All three HAIS 
instruments operated without problems. Data analyses in the following 
several days will show if the data quality is as good as in-flight 
performance.

A couple of minor issues were identified and are being worked on. None of 
these are mission critical. As it stands right now we are ready to fly the 
GISMOS missions but the consensus at the debrief was that it is best to fly 
another test flight first. Therefore the plan for next week is to fly TF02 
on Monday afternoon and have a maintenance day on Tuesday to prepare for 
deployment to New Orleans on Wednesday.

We will attempt a 3.5 hour flight that includes the maneuvers to test the 
performance of the GV temperature and pressure measurements. The flight will 
take place over flat terrain, calm day, no waves and will consist of 4 level 
altitude legs at 7.5, 15, 25 and 45 kft with several airspeed variations at 
each altitude. Roll out at 11 am, takeoff time 1 pm.

There will be no power or access to the GV on the weekend. User lab on the 
NW corner of the hangar, as well as the main building and user room, are 
accessible with visitor passes.

Thank you and have a great weekend.
Pavel

All:

RF02 and RF03 of the GISMOS project have accomplished their objectives. The 
issue with the TDL instrument has been identified and is being worked on; 
TDL data for the last flight have been recorded on a standalone computer and 
will hopefully be recoverable. Satcom performed well with one short dropout. 
Data feed to the ground also performed well, serving as a good test for the 
upcoming START08 project.

The plans for the next week are as follows:

2/16, 2/17 and 2/18: No power or access, rest days

2/19 Tuesday: Maintenance day

2/20 Wednesday - RF04, overflight of NOAA bouys, land in Alexandria

2/21 - RF05, overflight of radiosonde sites, return to Alexandria

2/22 - RF06, overflight of radiosonde sites, return to Jeffco.

Takeoff time for RF04 will be announced on Tuesday but tentatively the plan 
is the same as last time, 0700 rollout and 0900 takeoff.

Thank you,
Pavel

Pavel,

FYI, I assigned project number 508 to the HEFT08 project.  I have uses
for it, but you can probably live without it.

All:

RF01 went reasonably well yesterday. The GV completed the research plan by 
overflying four NOAA buoys and landing safely in New Orleans.

Two problems were encountered during this flight: aircraft power issue and 
instrumentation issue. Aircraft trouble code was cleared by the crew upon 
arrival at Lakefront, so the aircraft is ready for a mission on Thursday. 
The instrumentation issue (TDL instrument inop; this was the first flight 
for the TDL, which did not participate in test flights) is being worked on. 
It is unclear if this issue will be resolved in time for takeoff. The GISMOS 
mission scientist informed us that while the TDL data are desireable, 
takeoff will not be delayed if it is not repaired.

Data transmission to the ground, RT chat and satcom overall worked very well 
the entire time.

Takeoff time is 0900 local time. Join us on GoogleEarth, tracking the RF02, 
and on chat with RAF and the airplane; both are active right now. Dropsonde 
releases are planned for this flight. Another dropsonde flight is planned 
for Friday.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

Plans for this week:

Wednesday 2/20: 0700 rollout, 0900 takeoff for RF04, landing at Alexandria 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_International_Airport).
RAF made reservations at the hotel and will have rental cars; plan to 
carpool with RAF staff or make your own arrangements. Expected cost for 
rooms is $120.

Thursday 2/21: RF05, power-up and takeoff TBD, dropsondes planned for this 
flight

Thursday 2/22: RF06, power-up and takeoff TBD, return to Jeffco

Monday 2/25: TF03, pressure and temperature calibration maneuvers for the GV 
state parameters definition. Local 3.5 hr flight from Jeffco, coming back to 
Jeffco.

Data files are available for last week's research flights:
ftp://ftp.eol.ucar.edu/pub/temp/users/pavel/heft08

The total research flight hours used is 22.3 out of 40 total.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

The plan for Tuesday, 1/26/2008 is to conduct TF03, carrying out flight 
maneuvers to help understand the performance of the research pressure and 
temperature measurements. Any other measurements will be accommodated on a 
non-interference basis with the primary flight plan.

Rollout will be at or shortly after 0800 and the airplane wing will be 
washed on the ramp. Research power will be provided at or before 0900 with a 
planned 1100 takeoff. Given the forecast for some snow, we will check the 
weather conditions and could delay take-off up to two hours. Estimated 
flight duration is 4 hours.

We may cancel the rollout and / or flight depending on the weather 
conditions, so check with us in the morning.

Thank you,
Pavel

Hi all,

The GV took off today at 11:30 on HEFT08 TF03. They will be flying  
near Scott's Bluff for air maneuvers. We expect the aircraft back at  
15:30, approx.

Dear all:

I have to attend a loadplanning course at Buckley AFB and will not be 
available for the next two days. Please contact Jorgen Jensen at 
jbj@ucar.edu or x1028 if you have any pressing issues related to HEFT08 / 
GISMOS project during 2/20 and 2/21.

Flight operations for GISMOS have been planned out for the rest of the 
project and I do not foresee any issues.

See you on Friday!

Thank you,
Pavel

Hi Ron, Janine,

Could you archive these files unless you already have?

Thank you,

Pavel,

I am in the process if developing a script to archive these files (since 
this is data from a new HAIS instrument, we don't have a script in 
place). So they will be archived soon (this week)! I'll email when done.

Thanks,

Janine

Pavel,

It took longer than anticipated due to other priorities bumping it from 
the top of my list, but the HEFT08 SID-2H have been archived to the Mass 
Store.
