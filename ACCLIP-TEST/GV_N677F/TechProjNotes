ACCLIP-Test TF01
Flight Tech: Kyle

Takeoff: 19:49
Landing: 21:46

Performed an Auto A2D Check and all looks good.

Can't detect a camera after takeoff. Tried running command through terminal window as well as icon with no success. Chris W didn't install something.  Fixed at 20:11.

Upper viewport gasket whistling. Checked again at 43k feet and whistle is no longer there. Whistle is intermittent.  Heard it again at 28k feet.

19:54 RWO stopped. Cycled power at 20:04. Back at 20:05.

PDUMPR not hooked back up after cal.  Screwed it on finger tight.

Need acserver/downloads/ directory fully populated.  

GT-CIMS, ERICA, and NMASS all need flight maps, aeros, and chat installed and configured.

ACCLIP-Test TF02

Takeoff: 17:18
Landing: 21:36

No issues with A2D autocals. All offsets within 5 millivolts.

No comms with DSM RWO. Did not wake after multiple reboots. Had to pull RWO panel and reposition power connector for successful boot.

All data in aeros looks good pre-flight.

DSMRWO down at takeoff. Will recover on its own occaisionally, but never remains in stable state for long. Rebooting from panel and ads rack have no reliable effect.

17:48 - start of 1st descent down to 20,000ft into clouds.

18:01 - start of 1st speed run

18:00 - DSMRWO recovered on its own around 17:40 and remains operational. Rice appears to be giving good data. 


18:14 - end of speed runs.

18:25 - DPR ran away. Recovery at 18:46

18:34 - start of second descent to 20,000ft

18:49 - start of pitch changes

19:10 - DSMRWO remained up through pitch changes at 20,000ft. Crashed and rebooted twice during ascent back to 40,100ft.

19:40 - starting 2nd round of speed runs at 10,000ft.

19:55 - start of final ascent to 46,000ft
