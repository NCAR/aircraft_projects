Final checks before inspections next week. Ran auto calibration on cabin DSM's

Error message displayed:
defective card?    A2D011.dat
channel: 2 level: -10v
Internal calibration voltage measures as -8.64172v
This is an uncalibrated voltage out of the A/D card not the voltage input.  If you see this you should look at the intercepts on the cal and see how they compare.  If good this message can be ignored.

Pdumppl is about 7 mv different from cal.  All other variables are within 5 mv.
Calibration saved.

Spare server removed and take to the lab for update.  JC

6/20/15 
Spare server installed flight TF01 flown.

6/22/15
Removed PCASP and installed UHSAS for project.  PCASP had the same communications issue during TF01 that we saw during WINTER.
Testing UHSAS M. Reeves said that it should not go above 35C.  Esentially that means that it should not be run on the ground in the afternoon on this project as it will be to hot.
6/20/15
Trouble shoot TRSTB due to no data in TF #1 found temperature contoller bad,repairded controller and re test . It's functional now.  Ta

normal preflight.  3V-cpi computer had multiple reboots. No real solution but it did start working.  Just kept rebooting until it came up.


1447 Block out
1453 Takeoff
DPL oscillating a little  Will have to see if it continues.
Cameras started a bit late.

1530 Took power readings and found that the right side 60 Hz was only at 102V.  Not sure why and nothing we can do about it.  Will watch over the flight and at shutdown to see of we can find out what is causing it.
1653 MTP off
1703 MTP On
1744 MTP off
1754 MTP on
1831 MTP off
1837 UHSAS off
1845 MTP and UHSAS on
1848 UHSAS data system on (forgot to hit run Record on laptop)
1857 MTP power cycled due to bad oscillator.

Holodec boot sequence:
Boot computer with probe off
Turn on Probe power
Set IP address (last 3 are 147)
Start the rest of the programs
Computer will hang if this is not followed and might ned to be rebooted.

Post flight
Once all the users were done tried to find out why the right side voltage was low.  Tried pulling all the breakers but that did not change it, still 102V with no load.  Tried taking each AII out of the circuit and it did not change anything either.  Finally got a meter and measured the voltage on a plug, it was 115V.  Looks like the meter is reading wrong.

7/13/15
Maintenance.
Checked power at R1 box and found it was 115V.  Meter is definatly reading wrong.  We will look at it when we get to Sacramento.
Cleaned the 2DC mirrors, founf that they were no screws holding the mirrosrs in place.  Used yellow tape to hold them.  Will get screws in Sacramento.
Opened radome and verified that left rosemont is going to 25 Hz amp.  Radome lines were clear.

7/14/15
Preflight - noticed that DPL was oscillating again, will try cleaning it before the next flight.

Takeoff 1641
1727 Noticed that the Cameras were red on the status display.  Stopped and started recording on them.  They seem to be working now. No forward camera on the map page.

Maintenance day
Jorgan looked at CDP data and said it looked fine.  Bill looked at windows and said they look clean.  No acation taken on CDP.

Still to do
DP clean
CN juice
Look at power meter

Did HARP calibration with Sam on top of A/C.  Weight limit exceeded with sissor lift extended and two people on it...weight limit 250lbs with extension..500lbs without extension.  Need to figure out some other way.
Checked CDP windows, look good, Jorgen comfirms CDP is fine
Opened radome, pressure lines are good, no water.
Removed thermal switch from fan on radome DSM.  DSM on the ground with the radome closed is at 39C and slightly riasing as oppesed to 60C+
Cleaned 2DC mirrors
Ran A/D AutoCalibration All channels look okay compared to the last lab calibration.  There was an error on A/D 011 Ch 2 that the internal calibration voltage was low.  The Cal was okay so it is nothing to worry about at this time.
Removed and cleaned mirrors on both DPL & DPR in nose of GV and re-installed.
Oscillations in DPL no longer present.
Filled CN cntr w/BuOH.

7/17/15  RF-06 Tech Bill
Start of Day 0600, AI squared left side middle burned up upon power up..smelled and fault light came on, called Kurt, new one on way out...pulled panel off, and disconnected all cabling from affected unit.  Flight continues.  SatComm wouldn't come up via icons, have to do launch_mpds from terminal window to get to work. Take off at 0800 local.  MTP on and Holodec on.  Feature, on liftoff, camera on status page turns red, but camera's are fine on display and Nagios.  It's a feature.  Dancing the dance with Julie H. on MTP...so far so good... keeping up with Mike R. on UHSAS temps and running, so far haven't had to turn it off. Landing about 21:50Z, now on ferry, nothing to report rest of flight. Bill 

7/18/15  Maint. Day Hawaii between RF-06/07
Helped clean HARP.  Set up cradle for Tom B.  Camera computer not on techs list, not getting shut down, just turned off.  Added to list.  checked on lose power connection to HSRL dual power supply, no lost data, but 2nd power plug may have been loose during 3VCPI disk replacement.  Remember there's an extra network cable there that is open ended.  Checked 2dc mirrors, CDP windows, ok.  cleaned lense of forward looking camera.

7/19/15 RF-07 Kona HI, Start of day 0400 take off scheduled for 0630.  Take off on time.
Had to restart cameras after take off...using terminal window to launch_mpds instead of icon.  Had to restart one of HARP DSM's after take off.  No mixing ratios were reporting...including MR which I thought was tied to dew pointers, not VXL...in our DataSet Selection table for aeros it says it's mixing ratio to T-Electric which I thought was our dew pointers...alas, the reboot of VXL fixed it all.  Mislabed??  I think so.
Having to shut down both MTP and UHSAS on this flight due to heat.  Also much help trying to get HARP (Sam) working, got one fixed, then about 20:00 or so, HARP 3 gave out...many restarts, cables re set, VPN into that unit, trying many things...nothing working yet.
Multiple hours trying as much as we can on HARP #3, kinda run out of things to try...it's just broke.  Makes keeping track of MTP and UHSAS temps much more difficult, Reeves and Kelly Schick helped out greatly in keeping track as I was busy with HARP.  On Ferry to California now, hopefully no more issues, ETA 5:45 pm local.

Maintenance day
Looked at Dew point right as it was osciallating last flight.  Looked solid on the ground so did not do anything.  Suspect it got wet on the last flight but has dried out.
Replaced the center AII for the right side.  S/N HT001979 installed.  S/N HT00494 removed.  Removed unit to be shipped back to Jeffco. Helped HARP with Calibration.  Checked CN counter, it did not need filling. Jorgan checked 3V-CPI and siad that the humidity was fine and did not need to be purged.  
Jorgen and Bill did CDP cal's, copied file for Jorgen.  Bill, took 2dc probe off and realigned laser for better end diode voltages...tested on ground...by meter voltages are 2.0 volts...on airplane reports numbers more like 1.3 on ground?  John helped Kirk do HARP calibration.  Supported software for Radar and Tom B. as needed.  Show and tell for new PI coming down from Washington later this afternoon.  Replaced crushed ferrel on CN inlet.

Takeoff supposed to be 1500Z
1549 good data on all cloud probes.
1612 MTP off
Nose A/D temp running between 28 and 30C with fan on during low level legs.
1706 MTP off
1720 MTP on
1735 MTP off for Kelly, she reported a problem with the synthsizer, frequancy collapse.
1740 MTP on
1757 MTP off
1815 MTP on
1848 MTP off
1857 MTP on
2108 Removed stuck sonde from launcher tube. returned to #3 slot per AVAPS operator. When using the tool in the ads rack (which works very well) open the door to the launcher so that you can grab the sonde.  If you do it right it should not take more than a mimute to clear a stucksonde.

We might want to test a new dsm fan thermostat in the lab and see how it works.

7/23/15
Maintenance
Checked CN counter, plenty of liquid
Checked Dew Pointers since they were service mirror and rebalance after the flight.  They came up fine.  Removed the left flag so that Ed could see how they worked.  Tightend up the right flag as well.
Ran Auto A/D calibration.  Got warning message again about A/D S/N 11 with a low -10V interal voltage.  Again the card is okay so there is no reason to mess with it.
Card 1705 had 10mV difference on Ch03 (pdumppl). All other card had less than 5mV difference on any one channel.
Cleaned forward Camera window.
Looked at why Chem computer is not able to display RTPMS2D displays and see server areos sessions.
It was reported that the 2DC was running away on last flight and periodically since the beginning of the project. Turned on the probe and it was running away on the ground, had shadow or's of about 600 and occasional records per second. Pulled the mirrors and cleaned them finding one with a small black spot and the other with a smudge.  Pulled the condensing mirror also and it had a black spot and other junk on it.  After all cleaned the probe did not run away shadow or's were ar 0 and there were no records per second.


Thinking about the AII replacement, we probably should put contact cleaner on all the right side connections before the plane goes on ICEBRIDGE.


7/24/15

Pre-flight needed to clean bottom IR radiometer, used water and hand soap.
After takeoff the cameras stopped recording. Started again.
1554 MTP off
1804 MTP on
1844 MTP off
Getting good data on cloud penetrations.  2DC still good.

1955 UHSAS on
2024 MTP off
2035 MTP on
2037 UHSAS off
2045 UHSAS on
If the RUN button does not start the UHSAS you can hit COMMIT which will refresh the interface and then hit Run and Record.  This is quicker than stopping and restarting the program.
2116 MTP off
2122 MTP on
2124 UHSAS off
2132 UHSAS on
Problems with Omnistar during the flight.  Stuart has asked that the GPS antenna connctions be verified as tight on the next maintanace day. Could also try and ut contact cleaner on them and see if that helps. Looks like for the middle of the flight GGNSAT was bouncing all over the place.

7/27/15 :3V-CPI quit working at 9:58 Sacramento time, try to reboot computer several time but no luck ! seem get stuck in bios mode booting, no 3v-CPI data for the rest of this flight.ure voltage
7/28/15 : removed 3V-CPI out of the rack for trouble shooting,spend several hrs to trouble shoot,measure voltages ok, wring cable ok, reseated all cards ,still no luck.suspect motherboard problem.Ground
 team at Jeffco going to send tech support from Spec to diagnostic problem,RF 11 will fly without 3V-CPI turn on.

at 19:25 Tom reboot dsm 304 from remote and able bring everything back included rstb & trstb
7/29/15 removed 3V-CPI computer out of rack to diagnostic and repair.
7/31/15 Replaced 3V-CPI computer back on aicraft rack. after replace with new bootting disk .Everything work fine .  
Refilled CN counter with Butnal, did CDP calibration with Jeff S.  Cleaned 2dc 45 degree mirrors.  supported users as needed.

8-1-2015 RF-12 Tech Bill I.  Take off approx 0800 local CA time.  Multiple issues with Chemistry and PI (camera computer) aeros...Tom working on getting them some displays up...not sure what the deal is as all was once working yesterday during maintenance day.  Otherwise all is up and seemingly working now.  Camera's had to be restarted after take off.  Two of 4 aero's displays (chemistry and PI station) didn't have aero's to start, Tom got something working after some sweat.  8:52 first descent.  More rain on this flight than have seen previously.  2dc looks to have run away during parts of flight. CPI has time off 1 hour between control page and page that shows captured images.  CPI is daylight savings box not checked.  On ferry now at 20k 2dc is shut down due to runaway images.  


8-2-2015  Kona HI maintanence day...all systems came up fine, did not bring up INS which later proved to (think) HSRL had issues...talked to both Rich and Mike Dixon about how if we don't need, we don't bring up (hours on system).  Helped trouble shoot and check out various RAF laptops for aero's issues working remotely with Tom B.  Several shutdown reboots and check outs...initially PI station aeros wouldn't run time series data, would completely shut down all aeros functions...but it would do fine displaying aschii data.  Also checked and cleaned 2dc probe windows and lens.  worked fine on ground.  Bill

8-3-15  RF-13  Tech Bill I.  Take off at 6:26...rained most of night at hotel (Sheridan)..didn't like that hotel, older, kept well, huge, almost nothing within walking distance..very expensive for food. Airport though was dry, local storm I guess. Hans is PI for this flight...turned on Holodec MTP and GVR after take off.  2dc had some small targets on climbout..and then stopped when we exited rain.  Yeah!   All other systems seem to be working at this time..so far.  Lots of moisture around about 8 am dew pointers both flooded.  Took a bit for them to clear.  Doing our routine of MTP off during porpoise runs and UHSAS off during above cloud runs.
19:25 noticed cameras on Control page was off, thou all 3 images were updating...stopped and restarted camera process.  All lights now green on Control page. 

8-5-15 Did calibration of CDP's with Jeff S.  Cleaned 2dc probes.  Checked 3vcpi humidity and butanol for CN counter.

8-10/11-2015...back to back maintenance days...2dc cleaned.  CDP multiple calibrations.  3vcpi and CN instruments checked and ok.  Supported various users, mostly chemistry.


8-12-2015, Tech Bill I RF-16, last flight for project (research).  Take off delayed due to change in flight plan.  Take off at 08:28 local.   MTP started. GVR started, UHSAS started, VXCEL needed a couple of restarts..Cameras needed restarted.  Kinda busy start.  9:12, into some cloud/ice 2dc looks good, holodec looks good.  Had to restart Nose part of HCR during a manuver, seems it's internal IRU got messed up.  CN counter picked up ship plume, saw ship too, each time we passed by.

8/18/15  Ran A/D Auto Calibrate on Cabin DSM's
No error messages during the run.  DMS 303 A/D 1705 Ch 2 5mv and Ch 3 12 mv differences.
All others were 5mv or less.
