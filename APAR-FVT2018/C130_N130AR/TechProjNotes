4/23/18

Changed out analog in DSM 313 to a diamond to get 1000 Hz data.  Reconfiguared channels to get all HF on diamonds and GP's on NCAR A/D's.

Added network cable from main data switch to DSM 313 since it would not boot off a hub with DSM 310.

Verified channel setup and plane is ready to fly.
