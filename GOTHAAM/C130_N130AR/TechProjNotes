PP01 Hangar Notes
- Visible Pygeometer: VISTV(w/m2) and VISTC(w/m2) vars appear both be displaying a voltage measurement. Units for VISTV should be changed to volts. VISTC values need to be converted to (w/m2).
-UFT_4 units are reported in celsius in aeros. Units label needs to be changed to Fahrehneit.

Steady tone over "INT SCI GRP" channel. After takeoff it went away.

Climbed to 16.5k feet after takeoff which seemed to keep the cabin cool throughout the flight. *Cooled the inverters for a short while, too, but not as significantly as the cabin.

1744 - 1746 interesting event between DPB and DPT where there was a delay in tracking

DPT & DPB are a bit noisy today. May need another cleaning on next maintenance day.

Pre-Flight
- VCSEL Mirrors Cleaned and inspected by T. Campos. Laser intensity stabilized at ~1500.
- DSM323 came up on first attempt
- Replaced Propane handheld sensor batteries.
- Lost Research Power on transfer to engines. Full system restart.
- Aeros will not launch on L-10 inboard rack. Error Code "Qt platform plugin could not be initialized" Recomend re-install of aeros.



Flight 
- QCL Aerodyne not working after takeoff Britt S. and Eric A. were able to get it rebooted round 04:40.
- Cockpit laptop not getting a data feed from server. Restarting to sync with timeserver fixed the issue.
- Right Bus Inverter 3 fault indicator lamp went out (Likely after power dump). Monitored Inverter Floor Temps, Frequency, Voltage and Current closely for remainder of the flight. All values fell within normal ranges. Remaining 3 inverters held at ~11.2-11.7A for remainder of flight (Total Right Bus Load ~38A)
~0600 - AMS instrument offline. Likely due to PCI card out of alignment. 

Post Flight
- Recommend a full restart of plane power before closing up to see if the faulted inverter comes back on its own.
