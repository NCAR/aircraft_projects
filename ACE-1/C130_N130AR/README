In 2024 we updated probe meta data for size distributions to work with current
software.  This was mostly adding bin edges or cell sizes.

In addition we extracted the raw 2DC & 2DP data and made them available on the
data archive, and Aaron Bansemer ran SODA-1 on the files to produce standard
quantitative data from the probes.  These are archived also.
