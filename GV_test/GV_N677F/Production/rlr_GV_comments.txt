   1.  Add padding to the edge of the laptop's tray (like a wrist rest) to
        make keyboard use more comfortable.  It really dug into me.
   
   2.  Free up wiring so the laptop can be pulled forward out of the rack.
        Can it be "locked" when forward (or have a detent click) to keep it
        from freely moving in and out once it's pulled out?
   
   3.  Sun's reflection from the ADS station sheet-aluminum rack floor is
        wicked!  It could easily be covered with a non-reflective coating
        or even dark-colored paper.
   
   4.  Is there a way to make the cursor larger (perhaps even temporarily)
        so one can find it more easily?  There were times when I had trouble
        finding it.
   
   5.  Plot labels have very short ID color.  How about a big dot?

6.  Aeros -- remember:  "right click"
