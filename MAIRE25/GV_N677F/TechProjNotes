SATCOM did not initialize during Aircraft Power ON. "SDU AVAILABLE" and "SBU AVAILABLE" LEDs did not illuminate.

Pilots request that viewport cover(s) be removed prior to engine start to prevent FOD from being ingested into engines.

L5 display laptop not connecting to aircraft server. R5 display connecting just fine.

L3 rack has an Xchat configuration problem.

DPL & DPR data becomes unreliable above 30k feet. Back at 1708 ~ 25k feet

Pre-Flight
-DSM303 PPS_LOCK Error Status (4) at startup. Power cycled twice @1218 and 1228 with no change. 

Flight
Troubleshooting for SE's on router web page.
   -Added new UDP service to router on Port 31007.

Lear Position and Track visible in maps. Lost again after Lear landed to refuel. Lear position then became a mirror of the GV position.

Intermittent PPS Status on both Temp DACQS starting @1745. Right TDACQ (S/N: 5) dropouts more frequent. STATUS_TDACQ1 and STATUS_TDACQ2 shifting between 1, 2, and NAN sporadically. PPS Amplifier +5V LED is dim / flickering and all PPS channel LEDs are not illuminated.

No groundbot on xchat. Cycled SATCOM power to see if this would fix it (~1250). Successful.

Lear Position not working properly on Catalog Maps. Flight Track working OK. Eventually corrected from the ground.

~1510 High-pitched whistle heard at the right bulkhead near the primary connector panel. Whistle went away after a couple of minutes. Not sure the cause or the precise source. Could be a leak in the blukhead. Comes and goes through out the flight.

Preflight
- The pilot cycled power on SATCOM for some reason. Is this a part of their checklist - to ensure SATCOM is turned ON by pressing the button? It didn't seem to affect chat or LEDs (SDU/SBU) at the ADS rack. The switch in the cockpit is not intuitive, and can be confusing, because when it is ON nothing is illuminated. Only when it is OFF does it illuminate with the word "OFF". *The same is true with the Mission Power switch and this has caused costly instrument damage to the power converters in the past.

In-Flight
- Received an Iridium Call from Bo. Did not pick it up right away in the cockpit - it likely timed out. There is not an Iridium channel selection on the ICS box so Bo was called back using SATCOM. The Iridium handset battery appears to be dead and unable to make calls from the plane. A SATCOM call was made to test the handset at the ADS rack to confirm it's functioning properly.

- FWD Camera Images now working from the cockpit.
