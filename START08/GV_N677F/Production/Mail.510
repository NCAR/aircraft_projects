  Dear START_Team,


  On the workshop agenda, the plan for day 2's session 4 is for the PIs =
to give an short intro to each instrument data/parameters it provides, =
technique and performance information, use of the data in previous =
experiment. This needs to be very brief - 4-5 slides for ~ 5 min.  We =
think it is worth doing and should be  doable with the support of all =
instrument PIs. In addition, we encourage you all to bring a poster on =
the science the measurements involved, especially if you already have =
one, to display in the meeting room for further discussions.  Please let =
me know if you are interested in this short presentation.  I hope to put =
a list of presenters into next version of the agenda.


  Regards,
  Laura

Dear instrument teams:

I would like to clarify the certification documentation deadlines.

For instruments participating in HEFT08, which are NO-NOy, Fast-O3 and AWAS 
the documentation for certification needs to be at RAF by December 15. If 
you have it earlier please send it in so that Mark and Kurt can go through 
it in stages rather than getting it all on the 15th in one big pile.

For all other instruments (not participating in HEFT08) the documentation 
needs to be at RAF by February 1. Again, earlier is better and will allow 
for feedback from Mark and Kurt in case changes or additions are needed for 
documentation.

One month to three weeks prior to the first flights (for both HEFT and 
START) there will be a final cutoff date after which modifications to the 
documentation will not be accepted. This timeline depends on the schedule of 
the meeting with the FAA officials where the final documentation is 
approved.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

I will be out of the office the week of 3/31, returning on 4/7. Allen 
Schanot (schanot@ucar.edu) will be the RAF point of contact in my absence. I 
will call in to Al once or twice a day to hopefully help answer any 
questions.

The plan for the next week is to proceed with installations. RAF will 
conduct a walk-through (SAR/FRR preliminary) on 4/3 and the outcome of that 
will determine whether the current schedule

http://www.eol.ucar.edu/deployment/field-deployments/field-projects/START-08-project/start-08-upload-schedule

will hold, or if the weigh / EMI / safety briefing / test flights will have 
to shift to later in the week of the 4/7 or into the week of the 14th.
Please note that the safety briefing is mandatory for all persons who plan 
to fly onboard the GV.

If you have questions for me please E-mail them before end of day on 
Saturday 3/29. I will most likely be unable to read E-mail after that.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

Following today's meeting of instrumentation providers we have decided 
to cancel the preliminary SAR  on Thursday and go with the 
official/final SAR inspection 1000 Monday April 7.  The groups not yet 
ready will be working in the lab (no hangar access) on Saturday and 
installing the final components on Sunday.  Both the mechs & techs have 
been advised and will staff the work on Sunday from 0800 to 1600 MDT.  
Those who "absolutely" do not require extra time should not delay their 
activities.  All but QCLS & PANTHER are expected to be installed and 
fully functional by noon on Friday.  *This includes ADS-III with RAF and 
User signal checks!*  The RAF TDL will have to be removed for repairs 
next week, but the install should still be completed by Friday.  Its 
removal will will be covered by a MAF.  Repairs are expected to be 
completed in time for a potential test flight on Friday April 11.  With 
regard to the rest of the schedule, all other activities will continue 
as planned (weigh in, EMI tests, FRR and Safety briefing).  The delay in 
the SAR puts the test flight scheduled for 4/11 in jeopardy, due to the 
time it takes the FAA to approve the payload.  All should continue to 
work toward that goal and we will adjust next week as we hear back from 
them.

Al Schanot for Pavel

Hi Ron and Garth, I have just talked with Eron about the AG for the  
campaign. He told me that there is a need for software update. Please  
contact him for that or he will try to contact you. I hope to test it  
in March. Thanks. -Laura

Garth and Ron,

The license has probably expired for your AG systems. You will probably 
get prompted for a license number. Here is the new license information.


Your new license key is DKC6Z T3MX6 QX9JI BHK9V LLMNJ for 11 units. The 
order # was 11078

Eron

All:

We have collected contact information for most of the START08 
participants.  See attached EXCEL file for access to this info.  Most 
communications should still run through Pavel as Project Manager, but we 
thought you should have this info in case of emergency.

Dear all:

We will conduct the System Acceptance Review tomorrow at 8:30 am. The 
instruments need to be in flight ready configuration, fully assembled, 
plumbed and wired, to pass the inspection; they do not have to be On. All 
research teams are asked to stay off the airplane during the inspection, 
which should take about an hour.

At 10:00 am the GV will be weighed. This procedure will take about 1.5 hours 
and the GV will become available to science teams by lunch time.

We will conduct a safety briefing at 10:30 am in the RAF conference room 
while the GV is being weighed. This briefing is mandatory for all persons 
who will be flying onboard the GV and takes about one hour. After the 
briefing, a walk through the GV cabin will be given to point out the safety 
features of the GV. It will be given to small groups of people at a time 
since the space in the cabin is limited; if we run out of time, RAF may also 
do walk-throughs for flight crews prior to actual flights.

The EMI test is planned for Wednesday morning. For this test the GV will be 
taken outside to the ramp, all instruments will be turned On and transferred 
to engine power. (Transfer from ground power to engine power is seamless on 
the GV and does not require shutdown for instruments.) After that, the cabin 
will be closed and pressurized, and functionality of avionics and radios 
tested. It is possible that instruments will be asked to power off and on in 
case interference is detected. The duration of the EMI test is usually 1.5 
hours with cabin door closed, so instrument operators should plan to stay in 
the cabing for the duration of the test.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

Please see the message below. The PANTHER instrument can be contaminated if 
aerosol products that use HCFC-134a as propellant are used in its vicinity. 
Therefore, please don't use these products in the GV cabin, or consult with 
Dale Hurst or Fred Moore prior to using these on or mear the GV.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear Eron and Ron,
As per Laura Pan's request for AG and the possible problems with the  
AG Node at Jeffco, I ask Eron for any suggestions on a plan of action  
for helping.  I think perhaps ReadyTalk now that it is available to  
all UCAR employees may be a standard mode of communication or at  
least a back up to any problems that may be seen in the Start 08  
planning.  Any feedback will be appreciated.

Dear all:

I am glad to report that good progress has been made with the project 
instrumentation upload. All the racks in the aft and middle cabin are 
installed and we are ready for the racks in the forward cabin. MTP 
instrument is installed and checked out well on the ground. TDL is installed 
and will be checked out soon. VCSEL is arriving early next week. All 
instrument teams that are already at Jeffco are working hard on completing 
their installations.

However, there is a lot of work remaining to be done before the payload is 
ready for flight. The next too weeks will be extremely busy with 
installations and inspections, and I would like to ask everybody for 
understanding others' needs when working in the confines on the GV cabin.

I updated the START-08 upload schedule to provide a bit more detail based on 
how the upload is progressing:

http://www.eol.ucar.edu/deployment/field-deployments/field-projects/START-08-project/start-08-upload-schedule

Please let me know if you have questions with cc to schanot@ucar.edu.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all:

The plan for the EMI test tomorrow is as follows. The GV will be rolled out 
around 8:00 am. We do not plan to power up the aircraft in the hangar prior 
to the rollout. Once on the ramp the ground power and access will be 
provided to allow the instrument teams to prepare for the test; if you do 
not require power-up prior to the test, do not bring up the instruments 
until the test starts. At 8:30 to 9 am, Kurt Zrubek and the technicians will 
coordinate with the instrument teams and start the EMI test by requesting 
all instruments to be turned Off, and research power bus will be powered 
completely Off. This will establish the baseline for the test; after that, 
Kurt in coordination with the pilots will conduct the test by bringing 
research power up and asking people to power up the instruments.

Instrument operators are welcome to stay onboard even if they normally don't 
have a seat; we ask to keep the number of people to the minimum to help keep 
the cabin less crouded. Keep in mind that even if your instrument is 
autonomous, it will have to be turned off and on, so if you will not be at 
RAF for the test we will need instructions for powering it up.

We will not be able to support research related activities, like pointing 
the airplane into the wind, during this test. It is an electrical test only. 
Kurt Zrubek is in charge of the entire process.

The plan for the next few days is:
Thursday: instrument maintenance and preparations for test flights
Friday: Possibility of test flight 1 and 2, provided the FRR following the 
EMI test goes smoothly.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear Al and Shannon, I heard that there was a misunderstanding today  
for the Access Grid testing.  For the daily operational meeting, I  
feel the best option right now is still the access grid between the  
RAF conf room and ACD Fl0 AG unit.  From the FL0 group, we have Bill  
Hall as the contact person. If Shannon is still the contact person  
for Jeffco, could we try one more time to get it setup? I am still  
hoping for an operational meeting dry run at jeffco after Pavel comes  
back.  I hope to show the FL0 group the AG setup before that.  Thanks,

Laura

Dear all:

Test flights have been re-scheduled from Friday to Monday, 4/14/2008, to 
give instrument teams time over the weekend to finish up calibrations and 
instrument maintenance.

We will still hold a meeting at 2:30 today to collect information on status 
and needs for weekend access to the hangar and airplane to allow 
re-installation of instruments in preparation for Monday flights.

Thank you,
Pavel

As you all know the kickoff meeting is moving to Tuesday due to the  
test flight schedule change.  Jim Bresch and I will be using the  
Monday 3-4 pm slot for a forecast test at JeffCo conference room.  We  
want to test the Access Grid connection between Jeffco and FL0 the  
same time. Hope Ron and Garth could help with that. Thanks. -Laura

Dear all,

Today's GV instrumentation status meeting has revealed that the payload is 
in good shape. Several instruments require completion of calibrations, and 
others need software changes that are expected to be finished by Monday. At 
present, PANTHER, UCATS, NO-NOy HIMIL and TDL are off the aircraft and are 
being worked on in the lab. PANTHER and UCATS are expected to be ready for 
installation on the GV on Friday; TDL is expected to be ready on Monday 
morning. RAF software engineers have finished configuring the data system 
and as of COB today, all sensors are communicating with the data system. 
Final testing of data collection will be performed in the next few days.

Remaining tasks are real time data transmission to the ground and 
calibrations of several aircraft and user instruments.

All instrument teams are asked to send a representative to a short 2:30 
meeting in the break room again on Friday. At this meeting we will decide on 
the level and timing of RAF staffing and support over the weekend.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

The schedule for the next several days is as follows:

Saturday, 4/12: Hard down day, no access to hangars or aircraft.

Sunday, 4/13: Access to the GV with power from 8 am to 4 pm or until the 
last science team is finished with their tasks. All persons who need to work 
on the GV are expected to be at the facility in the morning. A mechanic and 
a technician will be at the GV to provide support, and all users working on 
the airplane should check in with them. Once people are done, they should 
remember to tell the mech or the tech that they are done, powered off and 
leaving. Once all people have finished their work and left, the GV will be 
powered down and access will cease. The RAF staff providing access will not 
wait until 4 pm if there is nobody working on the airplane. Therefore, 
please do not plan to come in at 2:30 pm and work until 4 pm.

Monday, 4/14: Check flight (TF01), roll-out at 7:45-8:00, takeoff at 9:00 
am, with the minimum crew to check pressurization and vibration of the 
external payload components. Minimum crew will include 1 person for NOAA 
PANTHER/UCATS, 1 person for MEDUSA/O2, Mark Lord and ADS technician. Flight 
duration one hour.
After landing, power and access will be provided on the ramp for a minimum 
of 2.5 hours. TF02, a full instrumentation test flight, is planned to take 
off at 1 pm for two hours. After landing power and access will be provided 
in the hangar until the normal closing time.

Tuesday 4/15: Maintenance day and project kick-off meeting at 2 pm in the 
Jeffco conference room.

Thank you,
Pavel

Hi Ron,

Pavel and I just met with Laura Pan. The START08 folks are here trying 
to learn how to use Access Grid in prep for their first meeting tomorrow 
(Tues) at 2PM. I see from your meeting below that you still have some 
testing to do.  When you come in tomorrow, could you contact Garth at 
ACD x1471 and arrange testing between Jeffco conf rm and FL0?  Also, if 
you could grab Pavel and I so we can learn the process that would be a 
big help so we can help people when you are out/on phased retirement.

If we can not get the Access Grid going for tomorrow, that is O.K. since 
most folks are planning to be on-site, but they really need it for Wed.

Thanks!

Janine

Ron,

Thanks for the response. I found and tried your instructions and got the 
error "Internet Explorer Cannot Display the Webpage" when I clicked on 
the program icon to start the access grid.  Let's work on this tomorrow 
together.

Have a nice evening!

Janine

All:

The plan for the next few days is:

Friday 4/18: Research flight RF01. Tentatively, takeoff time 0900 with 0630 
rollout. This time may be adjusted tomorrow.

Saturday: Hard down day, no power or access to the GV

Sunday: potential for RF02 but not for sure. This plan will be adjusted 
tomorrow and on Friday.

Thank you,
Pavel

Janine,

Eron Brennan (ext.1123) has one of his IT people working with the Access Gri=
d.
Nick at Insors (now Iocom.com) was supposed to have our virtual room=20
setup back
in working order late last week.  If that happened, then the access=20
grid should
work using the instruction sheet I put under the AG keyboard in the Conferen=
ce
Room.  If not then someone needs to work with Nick to get things going.

Sorry I spaced out this afternoon's test.

I will be in tomorrow (but not today).

Ron

Pavel,
if WZ or IP don't show for the experimenter's pre-meet - they are 
probably busy getting instr. maint done.
I talked to WZ earlier and things are coming along nicely - for NOy all 
is well, for ozone - NO bottle was changed, IP is doing calibration.
Teresa said she had noise on H2O but CO worked well. Hopoefully she'll 
be able to give you an update on H2O in person today.
Thanks,
Frank

Dear GV instrument teams:

To help control the cost of support for the project, please follow these 
simple rules for aircraft maintenance on Sunday:

1) Access is from 0800 until 1600 or until the last instrument team is 
finished, whichever comes first.

2) Please utilize this time window from as early as possible.

3) Please let RAF staff know that you are working on the instruments and 
tell them when you are finished and leaving. This will help prevent their 
waiting unnecesserily for people who left.

4) If you must complete instrument maintenance tasks in the lab and bring 
out the instrument later in the day, please let the supporting RAF staff 
know when you will be coming in. Contact info is below:
John Cowan: jcowan@ucar.edu phone 303-497-1064 (till noon only)
John Munnerlyn: munnerly@ucar.edu phone 303-497-1034
Jason Morris: jmorris@ucar.edu phone 303-497-1069

5) Unless notified to wait for certain instrument teams, RAF staff will shut 
down the GV and leave as soon as the last instrument team is finished with 
maintenance.

6) Software engineers are not scheduled to be on site for support. If this 
need arises please let me know and I will contact them to come out to 
Jeffco.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Pavel

Monday 4/21: RF02, Gravity wave study. Roll-out 9:30 am, take-off 12:00 pm. 
Duration 7.5 hours. There will be access to the GV prior to roll-out but all 
equipment must be powered off and ready to roll out at 9:30, otherwise 
takeoff may be delayed. RAF will start pushing people off power at 9:15 to 
ensure timely takeoff.

All:

The plan for Wednesday, 4/16: possibility of test flight in the afternoon. 
Duration of flight will be 2 hours max. I will visit all instrument teams 
that needed the extra time to get a status update, then a decision on test 
flight and post-flight access and power on the aircraft will be made.

The weather may be bad tomorrow afternoon which may affect our ability to 
fly; if the flight is cancelled, instrumentation maintenance on the GV will 
continue as normal.

The possibility of flight on Thursday will be discussed tomorrow based on 
the instrumentation readiness.

Thank you,
Pavel

duration 7.5 hours. Objective - sampling the tropospheric intrusion at 43-45 
kft extending from CO to Hudson Bay, Canada in a vertical sawtooth pattern.

Saturday 4/19: Hard down day, no power or access to the aircraft.

Sunday 4/20: Maintenance day, power and access from 0800 to 1600.

There will be no forecast meetings on Friday and Saturday; the next forecast 
meeting will take place on Sunday. Plans for Monday will be determined at 
that time.

Hi Ron

We would like to test the access grid this afternoon. It would be  
best to do it before the 3 pm meeting today.

Hi Ron,

I was able to set up the access grid before I read this message, so I think 
we are set. I have turned things off after we were done.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

The plan for the GV operations for next few days is:

Tuesday 4/22: Maintenance day, power and access 0800 to 1700. If you need 
extended access please let me know by 1500.

Wednesday 4/23: Maintenance day, power and access 0800 to 1700. If you need 
extended access please let me know by 1500.

Thursday, 4/24: RF03 likely, timing will be set as the model results become 
more certain tomorrow and Wednesday.

Extended forecast (about as certain as a weather forecast that far out):

Friday: possibly hard down day
Saturday: likely maintenance day
Sunday: possibly RF04

These may change depending on the conditions and will be clarified as we get 
closer to the end of the week.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear RAF staff,

I think that the Thanks for the success of START08 RF-02 goes to all of 
you - see the message below. Dr. Fuqing Zhang is a Professor at Texas A&M 
and one of the leading experts on gravity wave modeling. RF-02 was dedicated 
to his objectives.

Thank you,
Pavel

GV instrument teams:

Access and power on the GV on Tuesday will start at 0900 instead of 0800 due 
to the late return of the aircraft from the research flight.

Schedule for Wednesday is not changed.

Thank you,

Dear GV instrument teams:

There will be no power or access to the GV tomorrow, Friday 4/25.

RAF will provide access with power on Saturday, 4/26, from 0800 to 1730. 
That is correct, to 5:30 pm, only as necessary.

Please follow the same rules for access and maintenance this weekend as 
outlined earlier. Start as early as you can, let RAF staff know that you are 
here to work, and let them know if you are done. RAF staff will close the 
shop as soon as the last team is finished.

If you must complete instrument maintenance tasks in the lab and bring
out the instrument later in the day, please let the supporting RAF staff
know when you will be coming in. Contact info is below:
John Cowan: jcowan@ucar.edu phone 303-497-1064 (till noon only)
Greg Bruning: bruning@ucar.edu phone 303-497-1076
Jason Morris: jmorris@ucar.edu phone 303-497-1069

If they don't hear from you and all other users are done, RAF staff will 
leave and you may get no access.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Pavel

money and people's personal time.

Monday 4/28: RF04. Hands-on 0630, takeoff 0900, duration 7.5-8 hours 
(rollout / takeoff time subject to change based on the forecast meeting on 
Sunday, but no significant change is expected).

Thursday 5/1: possibly RF06

Dear all:

Due to the accumulating snow at Jeffco the takeoff has been delayed today. 
The forecasting team is developing a flight plan for a 1400 takeoff, five 
hour flight. We will re-assess the weather and possibility of takeoff at 
1230 and make a go-no-go decision at that time.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

Please read the following with understanding that there are two desires 
amongs the PIs and mission planners: first and foremost, fly the best 
meteorologocal opportunities, while allowing for adequate instrument 
maintenance time; second, conduct a science meeting to assess scientific 
progress.

In the light of these, the earlier schedule I sent out is now Option #1. 
Option #2 is:

Wednesday 5/7: Maintenance day
Thursday 5/8: RF09 (conditions look promising from the models)
Friday 5/9: Hard down / possible science meeting, or
Saturday 5/10: possible science meeting

In either case, tomorrow:
Tuesday 5/6: RF08, pre-HIPPO / START08 shared objectives, Gulf of Mexico 
with low descent. Hands-on at 0630, take-off 0900, duration 7.5 hours.

The decision on the plan for the rest of the week will be made and announced 
tomorrow at 3 pm. This plan will be either

> Wednesday 5/7: Hard down day; science teams look at data for science
> meeting.
>
> Thursday 5/8: Maintenance day, Science meeting at Jeffco conference
> room
> 0800 - 1100.
>
> Friday 5/9: RF09, Subtropical jet dynamics / tropospheric intrusion.
>
> Saturday 5/10: possibly RF10. Way to early to know for sure.

or the Option #2 outlined above.

Thank you,
Pavel

  Dear Team,=20


  As announced,  START08/PreHIPPO mid term science team meeting will be =
held on  9-10:30 am Thursday May 8th. We invite everyone who has been =
actively involved with the campaign to join the discussion on each =
aspect of the campaign ( flights/payload/data/forecast) and any =
particular science interest and discoveries from the data.  The =
intention is to communicate among ourselves  how well we are =
accomplishing the science and observation  goals before finishing all =
the flight hours .  The discussions are meant to be informal, =
interactive and brief (5-10 min). In general, everyone is encouraged to =
contribute to the discussion.  To make the time more manageable, we =
suggest that each instrument team being represented by one person =
initially. Additional contributions can be made if time is available.


  The meeting will be held in RAF conference room at Jeffco, with remote =
participation setup in the same way as the daily operations meeting. All =
in Boulder are encouraged to participate at Jeffco.  Breakfast type of =
food and beverages will be served.


  Cheers,
  Laura, Elliot, Ken and Steve

Dear all,

Today's planning meeting was short and sufficient to see that there are some 
interesting features brewing up for next week's flights. For now, the known 
schedule is the same as the one from yesterday:

Saturday 9/10: Maintenance day, power and access 0800 - 1600 or until the
last team is finished, whichever comes first. As usual, if you are working
in the lab and need to bring instruments to the GV later in the day, please
contact RAF staff to ensure they wait for you if nobody else is working on
the GV:
Greg Bruning, bruning@ucar.edu, 303-497-1076, or
John Munnerlyn, munnerly@ucar.edu, 303-497-1034, or
Brent Kidd, kidd@ucar.edu, 303-497-1089

Sunday 5/11: RF10 very likely, stratospheric fold over the Central U.S.
Hands-on and takeoff time TBD but in the morning.

Planning meeting on Saturday will hopefully shed some light on the best 
timing for the next hard down day (has to be on or before Wednesday) and 
potential for flights next week (three flights likely, including Sunday's).

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear GV instrument teams,

The plan for supporting START08 operations during the period from 05/16/08 
to 06/16/08 is as follows.

The GV will be moved to the new hangar around 5-6 of June to allow the 
upload of ELDORA on the NRL P3 as part of T-PARC project. The rest of the 
START08 operations will be out of the new hangar. Any user equipment 
operations on the hangar floor near the GV tail area should be moved out of 
the old hangar before 9 June.

People who need to remove instruments for working in the lab can do so 
during normal business hours. We will provide limited after-hours access 
this weekend to out-of-town teams if necessary, as we are aware that many 
people have been away from home for a long time.

The GV will remain available for instrument removal, access and calibrations 
throughout the entire down period during normal business hours. However, 
there are maintenance items that RAF will be taking care of that may require 
power cycles and limited access. Please coordinate with RAF if you plan an 
activity that requires uninterrupted power and access for a certain length 
of time. Keep in mind that the payload is certified as it is and is not 
supposed to change between phases. We will not remove racks from the GV.

Please document all instrument and component removals and re-installs in the 
rack book.

Also note that many RAF staff will be taking time off during this period and 
others have been scheduled to work on other upcoming field projects. Our 
ability to dedicate people for START08 support may be limited, so let us 
know in advance if you need support. We plan to resume operations on 6/9 to 
allow the payload to get back together, and will be fully staffed for flight 
ops by 16 June.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all,

Wedensday 5/14: RF11, northbound flight to the U.S. - Canada border to study 
a stratospheric fold. Hands-on is at 0830, takeoff 1100, approximate 
duration is 6.5 hours. The GV will be reserved for RAF use prior to the 
roll-out to repair the avionics component, so any activities in the main 
cabin prior to hands-on will be only on non-interference basis.

Thursday 5/15: Likely RF12, hands-on 0730, takeoff 1000, stratospheric fold 
over Colorado. If we do fly, there will most likely be a low approach during 
this flight. Approximate duration 6 hours. The final call on this flight 
will be made on Wednesday, and this would be the last flight of START08 
first phase. If we do fly on Thursday, the HIPPO meeting will again be 
re-scheduled, most likely for Friday 0830.

Friday 5/16: Likely maintenance day, access for instrument removal for lab 
work during the down period.

As of today, we are just over the mid point with the flight hours: we have 
flown 74.2 and have 73.8 remaining.

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear all:

Thursday 5/15: RF12, stratospheric fold over Colorado. Hands-on at 0730, 
take-off at 1000. Approximate duration 5.5-6 hours. This is the last flight 
of the first half of START08. There will be no more planning meetings until 
mid June.

Friday 5/16: maintenance day, instruments can be removed from the GV for lab 
work during the down period. We hope that we can stop power and access at 
1500 so that everyone can enjoy the end-of-the-first-half of the project 
party. The brats will be cooking by then, so working will be near impossible 
anyway with the aroma spreading over Jeffco :)

Thank you,
Pavel

Dear GV instrument teams:

In preparation for a flight on Monday, 16 June RAF will provide access and 
power to the GV until 5 pm on Thursday, until 5:30 pm on Friday and from 8 
am till 4 pm on Sunday, 15 June.

On Sunday, please follow the same access rules as in the past: start your 
work on the GV as early as possible and the earlier you finish, the earlier 
everyone will get to go home for the Father's Day. People should not come in 
at 2 pm and expect extended access; we will shut down as soon as the people 
who start working in the morning are finished. If you are planning to come 
in later please call in advance and let us know.

There will be a 2 pm forecast meeting on Sunday at Jeffco. There will be no 
forecast meetings prior to Sunday.

Thank you,
Pavel

All,
We've had a request for the START08 Chat logs so that the PIs can use
them to finalize their mission reports. I'd like to sanitize them first 
if possible,
so does it make sense to begin working on them soon? They would like RF9
first, but perhaps we could then follow with RF1 forward.....

Do you think Pierce's new tool is ready for this? Might be a good exercise
to see how it will work for future field projects.

Steve

Yes, I think the chat log scrubber should be used for this. It has  
been undated with undo capabilities, and is as ready as we can make it  
knowing what we do now. The person using the tool on the logs should  
be prepared to add in new patterns for detection, as questionable  
words show up which aren't presently being flagged.

Don,
OK, sounds like a good test. Who should do this, Pierce, with
perhaps a spot review by Ron?

I was wondering the same thing.  It might be good to get someone else 
using the program also just to make sure I have not missed anything.  
Maybe Ben and I could both work on the sanitations and split the files 
in half.  I am open to suggestions.

All,
Maybe for this first operational "test" and the fact that initially only 
the START08
PIs will see these (not open to the entire community yet), I would suggest
that maybe Pierce and Ben divide them up and do a first cut for them. It 
will
be a good test of the system (as Pierce suggests) and then maybe Ron, Don,
or I could do some spot checks. I see this system as work in progress as 
things
will get added over time. I think initially I wouldn't worry too much 
about the
"eating" or social stuff but rather focus to sanitize all the bad words 
and sensitive
information so it doesn't hold up the START08 PIs too long.

Ron, Could you point Pierce and Ben to the START08 files in case they don't
have them? Sound OK?

Thanks,
Steve

All,

Sounds good to me. I'll be glad to do some spot checking and tuning.

Ron,
Greg is on PTO and won't be back in the office till next Monday. Mark
was home nursing a bad cold, but had hoped he might be in today.
Never-the-less, he should be on e-mail, so I've cc:ed him here to help
us locate these chat files.

Thanks,
Steve

Sorry for the delay in responding, gentlemen -- I was in fact at the 
doctor when that mail was sent, and didn't check my work e-mail until 
just now.

Joe Vinson actually runs the script that copies the chat logs over from 
the chat server itself.  If they're not in 
/scr/dmg5/js1/vinson/chatlogs, which is the last place I heard about, 
please check with Joe to find out where they're landing.

Ron,
Could you track this down with Joe (if you hadn't already) and relay this
to Pierce?

Thanks,
Steve

I think that the chat logs are indeed in that location.  There are about 
80 START08 chat logs in that directory.   Ben and I will get started  on 
these soon.

I don't think there is anything other than general items dictated by common 
sense that needs to be scrubbed. There wasn't even much cussing going on, we 
should be good.

Thank you,

Dear all:

Today's research flight was cancelled due to a malfunction of an electrical 
indicator on one of the GV hydraulic valves. The valve has been ordered and 
is expected to arrive Saturday morning. RAF staff will install the part and 
test the aircraft on Saturday. If all goes as planned, there will be no 
impact on future schedule, so please plan as if we are going to Grand Forks 
on Monday.

Therefore, Saturday is still a hard down day with no access to the GV. By 
the end of Saturday I will send out an update on the GV status and update 
the hotline.

On Sunday there will be a planning meeting at 2 pm to decide on the course 
of action. If the GV is operational, we will fly Mondat and Tuesday back to 
back as planned before. If the GV is not operational, other options will be 
discussed and we will send out an update on that.

Sunday will be a maintenance day with power and access from 0800 to 1600 or 
earlier if people are finished with pre-flight preparations.

We would like to wrap up today around 1530 to allow for a more or less 
normal duty day and to let the Saturday crew go home, so science team 
cooperation on that will be greatly appreciated. If you must have access for 
longer than that, please let me know.

Stay tuned and check the hotline for updates.

Thank you,
Pavel

All:

A reminder: on Monday, all GV flight crew members should have their 
passports and any immigration documents that are necessary to get back into 
the U.S. While there is no planned landing in Canada, low approaches are 
planned in Canada and a landing may happen.

Thank you,

Steve,

I'd definitely say Pierce's ChatScrubber is ready for use.  At last
Wednesday's demo, it was quite obvious that his latest revisions to the
software will make it much easier to use.  It will be a huge improvement
over what I had to do for RICO -- peruse *everything* and hope I didn't
miss something.  And then there were my unintentional personal biases ...

The biggest challenge is finding the right person to actually run it
and do the work.  There is still a lot of judgment and wisdom needed to
separate the good from the chaff.  (For example, one needs to decide if
certain topics, like "where to eat," should be left alone even though
they may have no relevance to the "science."

The tool doesn't do everything, so the logs still need some perusal to
find things the tool misses.  Also, since the sanitization vocabulary and
search criteria can be loose for some topics, items that are flagged may
not necessarily need to be sanitized.  Do you have any reviewer candidates
in mind?

Ron

Steve,

I looked for the chatlog files where I last knew their location.  They
are not there any more.  I suggest contacting Greg Stossmeister or Mark
Bradford for their new location.  I just tried calling each of them and
got dumped into their voice mail boxes.  I'll try again later today or
tomorrow (unless you see either of them there at FL today and extract
the info from them).

Pierce,

There are two chat rooms to archive and sanitize for the START08 project:
   GV
   START08

According to Project Manager Pavel Romashkin, the start date for
harvesting them is 18 April 2008 (date for RF01).  End date is the
current date, since the project is still underway.

The source directory for the logs is:
    /scr/dmg5/js1/vinson/chatlogs/

The destination directory for both raw and sanitized logs is:
    /scr/raf2/Raw_Data/START08/Chat/

I just copied all the files for both chat rooms into the destination
directory for April, May and June through today (incomplete).  I recommend
ignoring all files before 18 April.  Someone should periodically harvest
the new chat logs as they are created (at least a day later to assure that
they are not truncated).

Archiving these files to the Mass Store will occur after completion of the
project.

You may want to touch bases with Pavel to see if there are any special
"forbidden" items that should be added to the scrubber's dictionary.

Ron

All:

Thursday 6/26: RF17, intercomparison with the DC8, flight maneuvers and 
short EB survey. There will be a low approach on this flight. Hands-on at 
0815, take-off at 1045, approximate duration 5.5 hours.

Friday 6/27: RF18, t/o TBD.

Saturday 6/28: RAF will start dismantling the racks in the cabin, beginning 
with the right side (R) of the cabin to allow the removal of QCLS. There 
will be no power or access for research purposes. People who need to remove 
plumbing from R racks, please do that on Friday after landing or on 
Saturday, or contact Pavel about any special handling for your equipment.

Thank you,
Pavel

correct. Low approach is in the U.S.

To all,

Here's a head's up from Santiago Newbery:

   Because of a temporary disk failure, Joe Vinson moved the chatlog
   directory to:
      /scr/rsf3/vinson/chatlogs/

I'm not sure if they will ever move back to their former location:
      /scr/dmg5/js1/vinson/chatlogs/

The harvested chat logs are still located in the directory:
      /scr/raf2/Raw_Data/START08/Chat/

Pierce,

According to emails I received from Project Manager Pavel Romashkin,
the START08 project ended last Friday (28th).  Weekend plans were to
dismantle racks in the GV.

I harvested the chatlogs through 29 June 2008; I'm not sure how many of
them you sanitized.

As for a destination directory for the sanitized files, locally it will
be:  /scr/raf2/Raw_Data/START08/Chat/Sanitized/

This directory should be populated by Janine Goldstein or me.  I just
tried mounting the U drive to my Linux workstation without success, so
perhaps Janine can do the transfer/copy next week.  Ultimately these
files (original and sanitized) will be archived to the CISL Mass Store
System.

P.S.  I'll log a help request to see why the U drive won't accept my
       user password.

Ron

Ben and I finished the chat logs a week or two ago.  I put the sanitized 
files on the U-Drive in my home directory so Steve could get them to the 
people who wanted them.  I am not sure where or how these will be 
permanently archived. Has the START08 project finished or are there more 
files that need to be sanitized?

Ron,

The sanitized chat logs will be made into a data set which can be 
ordered through CODIAC, as well.

Dear all:

Now that the project is over and everyone had a chance to catch their 
breath, I would like to invite feedback on what went well, what did not and 
what we could do to improve future operations of similar sort.

I would like to have a post project debrief next week before P-3 flight 
operations begin for the T-PARC project. The debrief will be held at Jeffco 
with a teleconference for non-Jeffco participants.

Thank you,
Pavel

Bob,

Pierce came to talk to me today about the START-08 chat log processing. 
I had him put his processing in /work/START08/chat_logs, including both 
the unsanitized and sanitized logs.  These logs need to be put into the 
field catalog (by Greg), and Pierce needs to put his chat log processing 
info into IVEN. Someone will need to teach him to do this as he has 
never done it before. The chat logs should also be a dataset on the 
START08 master list.

Currently, there is not a DMG START08 page, nor are there DTS pages. 
Since you are the lead on the START08 DM, I leave  coordinating all of 
this to you (-: Please work with Pierce and Greg.

Ron would also like the chat logs in an RAF dir. I will take care of 
that. I am going to go ahead and set up raw and processed chat log 
datasets in the DTS so I can keep track of changes and info so far. Feel 
free to work with them as you see fit.

Thanks!

Janine
