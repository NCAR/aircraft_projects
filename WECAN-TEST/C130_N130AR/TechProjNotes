WE CAN Test

Pre Project - Transducers were powered incorrectlly abd 3 burned up.  ADIFR, QCR and QCFR were all replaced prior to the project.  Calibrations were done on the new transducers.

At somepoint during the project it is our intention to replaced DSM 319 Viper with DSM 306 Titan.  We are not sure when that will occur. This will effect ADIFR and BDIFR so Pavel will need to be informed.

6Sept17...brought up data system, again DSM 318 A/D cards were red on status page, green 5V light was fully on, rebooted via power switch after 2 minutes...same results as 1st time.
Waited a full 5-6 minutes, power cycled again, and A/D cards came up normal...(heat issue?).
Continue to write results every day here.  BI   8:35...DSM's been up for 75 minutes...DSM 318 shows red on status page (Firefox)...5V green light on...power cycled..all came back...Need to watch this closely....NOTE: initial boot up, the time does come up correct on Firefox status page, you have to look at extended status (by clicking on DSM318) to see red error numbers..BI

7Sept17...initial DSM boot, time was matching all other DSM's...but again DSM 318 all red on firefox extended status page..IRIG and both A/D's...waited 5 minutes shut down with power switch on DSM...power reboot...all comes back, must wait 5 minutes or so though....second A/D takes 6-8 seconds longer than first to come up...BI



8Sept17  ....brought up system first time ...manually turned DSM318 off, brought up everything else....once all DSM's were up for several minutes...all (318) came up just fine...for a minute...then control page (not extended status page)...showed red sync time...?, restarted DSM318...A/D's red..and line one IRIG, sample/secbyte/sec red....after 5 minutes, turned 318 off and on, came up normal...

13Sep17 DSM 318 removed for troubleshooting.

14Sept17...EMI test, 130 out on tarmac, timeserver took forever...closed all hanger doors, reset power on timeserver, after 10 minutes to finally found itself, allowing DSM's to boot.  DSM 318 not on for EMI...

9/18/17 Ran auto A/D calibrate.  All DSM's look okay. DSM 318 not installed for this test.

9/19/17 DSM 318 installed.  After 1/5 Hours it was noticed that the Irig-Unix time was -22622176 seconds.  Time is green and updateing but analog temps are NAN.  Also timing is NAN in Aeros but working on controls page.Rebooted DSM at 1449. Reboot seems to have fixed problem.

21 Sept 17...TF-01...tech BI..a/d card 001 (DSM318) preflight failed diagnostic test..ch 0 and ch 1...
Flight to be a 2-3 hour test flight...shake and bake...TO around 1100 local..DSM 319 had to be rebooted after Webster...no research GPS...Power switch between gnd and APU was very rough...killed server and nimbus, restart of both and then DSM's worked...we are now on RF-02
DSM 319...Adifr/Bdifr quit at 1702...reboot brough all back...that's second time..Del laptop, front left Dell810 had harddrive failure, sometime after power bump...all we can do up here is try and let it fix itself...taking some time to do so...rest of flight was ok...landing about 1:25L
No research GPS, no RTH2 no TRSTB

9/21/2017 (D.Allbee)
Informed of Temp Probe issue during TF01. No concise details.
According to the channel setup sheet, RTF1 should be DSM320 - A/D card A0 - Ch. 3.
Troubleshooting, I unplugged each analog input connector at the back of DSM320. The RTF1 signal was lost when the connector to the A2 card was disconnected. This is repeatable.

22Sep17...installed RSTT into header and hooked up twinax.
RTH2 now working..Chris needs to shift RTH2_A1 to RTH2.  Ta troubleshooting TRSTB.  GGLAT/GGLON working now. TRSTB working, cables not labeled clearly, not plugged in.
