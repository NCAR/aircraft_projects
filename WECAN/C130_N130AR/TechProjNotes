Starting Tech notes for the project 6/18/18

Pre Project
Installed new router in ADS rack and went to 1 network for the aircraft. The Satcom is not hooked directly to the new router and the router in the video rack is unused. There will not no icon for satcom on the desk top.  all controlled by software now.

The ADS system and timeserver are running on data power with no UPS's.  UPS's are still installed and could be used if needed.



Ran Auto A/D calibratrion.
aft overhead right DSM 324, card 002 ch 3 measuring -8.73 with -10V input.
Video rack DSM 321 card 1601 Ch 3 measuring -8.87 with 10V input
DSM 323 Card 0 Ch 0 off by 22mv. Card will need calibration after the project.
DSM 324 Card 0 Ch 1 off by 5 mv, Ch 3 off by 9 mv
All the rest of the channels were off by no more than 2 mv.

7-13-18 TF-01 tech Bill TO was at 11:10 ish
Did a2d test, all passed except RSTT which is card 002 ch 3
TCAB L-1 and R-8 are not working properly at this time, do not trust temps from them.
L-6 TCAB is accurate
SDI flow is not accurate at this time
Aero's reported temp under the floor for our power system is not accurate at this time
Delay due to Teresa UPS not working anymore.
Bay 3 was hottest at 113 degrees before take off
SDI pump turned on just after take off due to power issues during APU switch
no 2dc diode voltage from LPC
when trying to get 2d images from 2dc's just gives me all variables to choose from can't display 2DC images
Lost SatComm around 11:22
up to 14k feet, bay 3 still at 114 time 11:40 local
TCAB L-6 about 90 degrees, now at 85
SDI tube needs some work at coupler above blue box...not enough flow for users
TCAB L-6 now at 82, 12:10 local
Seat at L-7 headset doesn't work 
Lost Satcomm again at 12:12 back at 12:28
Bay 3 temp dropped to 97 degrees at 20K
Lost SatComm at 12:48
hour long ride at 1,000 feet to Greeley
Don't see anything from Radar Altimeter on aeros, but unit display looks fine.

07/16/15 Maintenance day
SPP200 would not connect to serial either RS 323 or 422, still investigating.
Ran A/D Autocal, same as befor except DSM 323 card 0 ch0 showing 20mv offset.
Looking to see why TCAB-L1 is reading wierd and not showing up on analog test page.

7/18/18
Did testing on PCASP. with DMT software proved out that can wiring was good.  Went to Ser 5 and it did not work.  Tried loop back and it did not work.  Went to Ser 9 and it worked.  Left probe on Ser 9 for the project.

7/19/18
Satcom testing.  Towed plane in a circle and found that when changed to Starboard antenna (I thin) it would try and dail and AFIS sat that would could not do internet with.  Also suspected that the RF switch might be bad.  RF switch replaced.

DATE: 07/20/18

Dave to add flight notes.

SATCOM stayed up for the entire 2.5 hr flight, Craig Poyner confirmed via logs.  A 360 circle maneuver was done @ ~ 17:50 (11:50) MST the connection stayed up.  Prior to departure on 7/19 the high power relay was swapped for a new unit ,P/N 301706-500 .  At this point point more testing needs to be completed to verify if the swap truly fixed the antenna hand-off issue.  KAZ

7-21-18 Maint. day, worked on fast 2dc, helped move and change alot of bottles, helped where needed.

7-23-18

3 hr warm up, power was dumped in trying to go fromGPU to engines 1 & 2, terrible dump.  5-10 secs in the back.  When trying to recover with R-Bus on engine 2, cockpit down shifted and dropped everything again.  Flight was then canceled.  Performed engine swapping test with 3 & 4.  KAZ

PCASP and CDP tracking nicely 1600
Camera's just are not going to work on this flight, tried fire wire in out, nope...worked for a bit after getting images on map page, but then quit for good, was not rough when happened.
1830, working our last leg, be headed for Boise shortly.
ETA about 2000...give or take
Punched a few clouds on way home...flew like a drunk driver.

27July
Worked on cleaning CDP windows and Jorgen cals for him.
RW pod DSM gave trouble this morning, reset all connectors, including power, used power switch on DSM...and it started working.  Rebooted it multiple times, worked every time here tonight.
Kurt worked on VCSEL using camera paper to clean...best he got was about 1.7-1.8 volts of LSRINTAMB.
Frank worked on his inlet with Dave and Ed..took inlet off looking for leak.
Put Cloud Sampler Probe back on.
U of Wyo. took box off for Rudra.  
Took Fast 2DC off for Josh.
2dc's mirror's look good, maybe once a week to clean/look at them...VCSEL and CDP need cleaned every flight.

8/01/18
Flew time server in simulation mode for RF03 and 04.  Worked fine, unit now seems to acquire satellites in “Normal” mode.  Received spare timeserver setup and tested found 9/12 sats and stratum 1.  Will use if standard unit fails again.

Replaced unheated Temp probe #3243 was taken out, #2932 was put in.
Timeserver came up with two red lights again this morning, will be in repeater mode.
RF-07 flew, (see Dave's email notes)

7Aug18
Worked on timeserver again, took it out of rack and reset all connectors.
Plugged old one in and it works, if your willing to wait 20 and I do mean 20 plus minutes for it to lock on.
Put in newer timeserver again, and it worked fine all day.
Dave pulled A/C server (to look at camera firewire issues) reset all connectors associated with firewire board in A/C server.
Bill cleaned VCSEL...it got into a bad software mode...cleaned it 6 times without LSRINTAMB being close to .2 (more like .1)...after software reset
it looked much much better...(cleanings were not the answer).
Bill and Jeff Stith cal'd and cleaned the CDP...(yes you can imagine how long that took).
again 40um before cleaning, then clean windows, and do 40,30,20,10,5um glass bead cal, note time started and time finished, tell Janine and she gets file and puts it in special place for Jorgen/Jeff to view.
General clean up and assisting with gas bottle changes and driving Miss Daisey's (science types) down to Hanger 6.

9Aug18  
Cleaned VCSEL mirrors, cleaned CDP, cleaned RSTB's windows before research flight. 
RSTB1 has many pits on the lens-window.

10Aug18
Maintenance Day

CDP Cal Start: 15:10
CDP Cal Stop:  15:47

Cleaned UV Hygrometer.

Cleaned both Buck dewpointers.

John C. created a cute blanket for the unheated temp probe. Also cleaned with water.

Cleaned both 10um and 25um 2D probe mirrors.

Removed DSM 319, took apart and cleaned with contact cleaner. Reinstalled.  Josh saw that the timing card was resetting and the analog card was resetting.  Hoping cleaning will fix it.  Noticed a pretty heavy coat of dust on some cards during cleaning.


13Aug18
RF10
Tech: Kyle

Takeoff: 18:30
Landing: 00:40

Had to put timeserver in simulation mode. A10 hangar open. Possible GPS repeater?  John C tried blocking the hangar with some shield but did not work.

Steps to put Meinberg Time Server in simulation Mode
        reference time menu -> setup GLN receiver menu -> setup simulation mode menu ->
        press up arrow to enable simulation mode
        press OK

Had to reboot DSM 320 to get serials. That fixed it.

Cleaned VCSEL during preflight. lsrintamb=.18  Needed to stop and start program.
Alcohol for VCSEL.  Acetone for CDP.

Power dump during power swap.  Signal to disconnect ground power before swap.  With a little massaging, most everything came up.  Teresa CO and CFDC having issues.

Had to reboot DSM 319 to fix serials and cockpit data after power dump.

Had to reboot Satcom to get it back after power dump.

Saw returns from PLWC, RICE, 2Ds, CDP, UHSAS, and PCASP.

QCR iced up at 23:38.  Radome heat brought it back. 

May have slightly affected the unheated temp probe for a short time but started to line up about 10 minutes later.

Timeserver came up in Stratum 2. Tried many things and eventually swapped out the coax cable from the timeserver to the splitter and it came up in Stratum 1.  Tested with A10 hangar door open and closed. Today, the suspected issue is either a bad cable or the amplifier in the antenna is overdriving the GPS receiver inside the timeserver.  The coax cable that was used to replace the original is longer and a smaller diameter with adapters which adds some attenuation.  

Replaced Timing card in DSM 319 due to card not holding time and resetting occasionally. Card 40869 was removed and card 30274 was installed. SE looked at the DSM and said the problem was fixed but will check again tomorrow.
Cooling fan 319 fail to work after replaced Timming card, open the shell cover of DB9 connector ,readjust the pin contact ,now it work fine !

Moved SPDB on the R-9 rack from the forward side to the aft side of the rack to take the Chem UPS out of the circuit.  The cables all reach now in the same circuits that they were before.

Looked at 2DC-25.  Saw that the end diode voltages were about 3.6V to start.  This was about the same as before RF10.  In RF10 just at takeoff the voltages went to 4.7V which were pegged at the top rail. Also Kyle reported the the images on the flight were squished flatter then they should have been. They are sending the other probe out from Jeffco for us to replace prior to the next cloud flight if at all possible. Ran a spinning disk on the current probe and also looked at the mirrors, they looked good.

Removed the top HARP radiometer as the gasket was found to be ripped. Replaced the gasket and reinstalled.
Gaskets ended up ripping because there were 2 gaskets put together (one attached to the plane and one attached to the instrument mount).  This should not be done in the future since they will tear each other apart.

Opened radome and did not see anything in any lines.  Visually checked all fittings and they looked okay.

Installed the clould collector probe


8/15/18
RF11 Preflight
Replaced 2DC-25 S/N 3 with S/N 1.  put on a spinning disk and the particles looked slightly squished.  Looked at end dioses and ther were 1.0 V.  Decided to verify mirrors were clean. after cleaning 1.1, 2.98, 0.9. did not recheck with disk.

Timeserver came up okay today.

Cleaned VCSEL. Final readings - lsintamb was 0.14, lsintref was 3.58 and refindex was 150.

Ran A/D Auto Cal. DSM 324 card 0 ch 3 RSTT is 8mv offset, DSM 323 card 0 ch0 UFT4 is 21 mv offset rest of the cards looked good.


BO 1954
TO 2000

2027 HGM232 is NAN will check setup since we had the DSM apart before the flight.
2036 Bay 4 is 107 about 30 min after takeoff.
2045 Getting a nocode indication on DSM 323.  Did not see it earlier.
2055 nocode cleared
2102 TRSTB breaker was found off.  Turned it back on.
2107 2DC-25 is saturating in the 32 diode again.  This time it saturates for a while and then is okay for a while.  I have not been able to find a corolation.
2131 Looks like the TAS reported by the 2DC-25 is about 2 m/s faster than what the plane is reporting.  I noticed that the spinning disk reported 35 m/s and I thought it was supposed to be 33 m/s?
2159 It looks like there might be some corolation between the 2DC and smoke plum penetration.  End Diodes seem to go up shortly after smoke plume penetrations.  Plot end diodes and 2DC conc.
2249 Frank noticed a large (30 degree) difference between the mission coordinator wind direction and the Aeros (radome winds?). He is asking which is more accurate?
2251 Underfloor temps bay 1 to bay 6: 93 89 100 97 95 96 
0008 ADIFR BDIFR and QCR stopped working. All are serials on DSM 319.  DSM 319 reset. All signals came back.  Looks like the serial card locked up for some reason

It would be very helpful to know what bins they are supposed to fall in.
We are not happy with 10 um but there is no 8 um beads here. The first shot looked like it has some in the correct bin in the first second or so.

Cleaned the VCSEL got .175 on the lsintamb - Cleaning the holes made a big difference.  We will do that in the future.

Looked at the 2DC per Josh's e-mail.  I noticed that as I lossened the back hemisphere that the end diode voltages decreased fron about 2.8 down to 1.7V.  We wiggled connections but could not find anything that loooked like a bad or weak connections.  There were no changes at all anyware on the connection string.  When we were completed I lossened the mirror screws and wiggled them until we has\d a 32 end diode voltage of 1.45V.  Everything is now tight and back together.


19Aug18
Maintenance Day

Booted all DSMs and checked Aeros data.  We are good for the next flight.

Did an A2D calibration.  DSM 323 A0, Channel 0, Serial #1606 is more than 10mV off from original calibration.  It is the UFT4 variable.  We think it's not necessary to change since this variable is not really reading correctly.

Installed the Cloud Collector for next flight.

RF13
Tech: Kyle

Takeoff: 19:04 
Landing: 02:14

Took 4 Start Cameras with the icon to get cameras to go green on the Status page and display on the Camera Viewer page.

Have a No Code on DSM 323 during preflight and after takeoff.  Cleared itself at some point during the early part of the flight.

Campfire smoke smell just prior to A/C becoming cold just after power swap.  Warm air was blowing before. I believe it is previous flight sampled smoke getting into the air conditioning system. Will probably experience this in future preflights.

It appears software folks put a doubler in the 2D10 diode voltages but am unsure because I was uninformed.

2D25 diode voltages look acceptable with no railing.

DSM 324 may have had an analog channel shift. Rebooted at 19:21 with an analog fix but the serial card was not happy.  Rebooted again at 19:24 with everying looking good. 

400Hz Frequency meter bounced around on all three phases anywhere from 600ish up over 1000Hz.  Didn't notice it for awhile.  We should pay attention if it happens at power swap to engines or takeoff.  I did look at it after initial startup and it looked good.

Saw returns from the UHSAS, PCASP, and 2D images from both 2D probes.

I think the unheated temp probe is getting gunked up with smoke. We should try to clean it.  Could be what happened to the last one and what is affecting the measurement.

Should also clean the Buck Dewpointers. DPB was less responsive than DPT.

VCSEL2 lsrintamb was down to .04 towards the end of the flight.  

Saw returns from PLWC and RICE react to some clouds in the last half hour of flight.

8/23/18
Pre Flight for RF14
Plane was gone for 2 days due to a maintenance issue.  Arrived at 1115 for a 1400 takeoff.
Clean CDP windows
Clean VCSEL 0.2 lsint
Install Cloud Collector
Ran A/D Auto Calibration it was as expected.  RSTT was about 9 mv different but it seems like it is stable there.

2DC-25 End Diodes were 0.59 0.78 0.98 at startup.

BO 1957
Aborted takeoff due to oil pressure issue.
Switched to APU frquancy is good on power box

Frequancy only messed up on engines. seeing 400 to 450 Hz now.
BO 2034
Lost power due to cockpit error, restarted in runup area.
TO 2057

All of our stuff looking good.

2309 The meter for Data Power voltage is reading strange. Was 95V.  I tapped it and now it reads 58V.  I have measured the voltage at a plug and it reads 115V.  It looks like a meter issue and we will chase it down next maintanece day if we get a chance. If not we will just monitor it.

Saw some nice droplets at the start of the final under cloud leg.
  
No major issues for maintenance tomorrow.

Did not see then end diodes for the 2DC-25 saturate during the flight at all.

They are very happy with this flight.

0131 Turned off the UHSAS laser per request from Reeves.

On Ferry to Boise under floor temps were around 85, High bay 4 at 96 low bay 2 76 others in the mid 80's.

Cleaned DPB and DPT
Removed some material that looked like small bug guts from QCFR after Britt and I looked at the probes. Will need to see if it improves the measurement.
Supported users as needed.



ICS testing:
Looked at instructions.  The INT SCI GRP channel is split so that not all the APC's have access to it.  Every APC has access to the INT SCI OPS channel it is also the channel that all the seats in the back are tied to.  We would recommend that in the future the Science Crew uses the INT SCI OPS channel for discussions and the Pilots go to INT SCI OPS channel to talk to them.  The INT CREW channel will be used by the FE, Tech and Pilots to deal with aircraft stuff like power changes and other issues in flight.

Tech: Kyle

Takeoff:19:41
Landing:21:48

Timeserver came up in a Stratum 2 position. Tried all the usual fixes with no success.  Forced it into Simulation Mode.  Suspicion is interference from somewhere at the airport.

DSM Server crashed three times.  Catherine had to kill some Zombie :) processes and that fixed it.

Not seeing Novatel data in Aeros through UDP or Serial prior to taxi.  After takeoff, seeing Aeros Fixed ASCII serial Novatel data every other second.

Lots of timing issues this flight.  Can see it in Aeros serial data.

Lost satcom 19:46.

No VCSEL2 this flight.  


Pack out Day 1,

We powered up the timeserver and it again came up in stratum 2.  We took it to Simulation Mode and brought up the data system.  It all came up fine today. We are going to leave it in Simulation mode for the flight back to Jeffco so we do not have to mess with it on a short preflight,
Packed and supported users the rest of the day. Last day with power on the plane.











Steps to put Meinberg Time Server in simulation Mode
        reference time menu -> setup GLN receiver menu -> setup simulation mode menu ->
        press up arrow to enable simulation mode
        press OK
	Wait
	Press Escape Multiple times to return to clock and check time
	Confirm that DSM's are synced in the control menu on the ads station
	If the time needs to be changed go to
	  Referance time menu
	  setup gln reciver menu
	  init gln reciever
	  init reciever time

	use arrows to set time and press OK
	escepe to return to main menu

Resetting the time changes the NTP time.  Use only if not getting GG variables. Need to be within 1/4 second may be 5 second delay from when you press the OK button to set time.





To Do after/before each flight
Cal, clean and cal CDP
Clean VCSEL lsrintamb=.18
Prior to RF 10 the following were cleaned - UVH, 2DC Mirrors, both DP's 
2DC 25 replaced prior to RF 11, End diodes were 1.2, 2.9. 1.2

At start up, Time Server came up Stratum 2, placed in sim mode, troubleshooting in progress. 

ACServer on web page status red "not started". Referred problem to SE (Catherine), IT (Mike) also collaborated. Problem solved.

Initial check out, all instruments okay.
Housekeeping present all probes available, Dewpointers okay
A2D DSM318 A1  (A2D001) test A2D does not work. Voltages look valid, will troubleshoot.
A2D DSM321 A0  (A2D1601) ch2, 47mV off

Networking problem. Mike, Catherine and Chris trouble shoot to hub at L1. Bad power cable.
Cable replaced, plug too long, sheetmetal adjusted for custom fit with large crescent wrench.

RTH1 and RTH2, on seperate DSMs, cycle power both DSMs but doubt that will fix it. Test 
A2Ds show nan. Unable to trouble shoot due to other more important problems, will rely on redundant measurements.

DSM318 stopped, cycle power, now okay, RTH1 and RTH2 now reading okay.
