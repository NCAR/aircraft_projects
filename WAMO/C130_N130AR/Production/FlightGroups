Revision 2
#
# This file contains flight equivelances.  That is "x == y"
# says that flight x should use the [nimbus] setup that was
# saved from flight y.
#
# Running all flights with TF01 setup is done to reduce the variable
# output to only those vars needed in production files. There are no cal
# changes or any other changes in Flight_tf01.
