To use:
PROJECT=TRAM (as root)
set_project TRAM (others)
adamserver (as anybody)
-or- rtrun -r 10 adamserver (only as root?)
serial_ingest -z (only as root!)
 [this automagically runs tram.up, which starts archive, covar, cockpit]
 [seems to run better if:]
rtrun -r 5 serial_ingest -z (as root)
CheckAster to view status.
[I wish I had these instructions written a lot earlier!]

kill -HUP [tram process] [to restart after problem]
