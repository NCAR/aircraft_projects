05Dec17 - Ran autocal today, A2D1706 card in nose dsm failed.  Warning messages on chnls 1 and 4.  Also, warning message on A2D019 - chnl 3.
A2D1706 ch 1 250 mV offset, ch 2 60 mV offset, ch 3 130 mV offset, ch 4 is
offscale, ch 5 is offscale, ch 6 40 mV offset.

Reset nose dsm, problem went away, suspect dsm boot error - Ta is happy:)

13 Dec 17  Ran auto A/D calibration.  All channels are okay.  Card S/N 19 Ch 3 has a warning message about the 10V being 8.5v but is still calibrated fine.

14Dec17 Checking GNI varibles, CAVP_GNI = about 500mbar. Not right because I have no trouble breathing. Hard power cycle DSM304, no change. Checked TestA2D, V= about 1.1V, s/b about 3.5V, changing in mV level so not frozen. Looked on all other A2D channels, nothing else near about 3.5V. Checked Vout @ GNI box with multimeter, = about 3.5V. Checked @ patch panel cable, = about 3.5V. Changed channel from 2 to 4 in Config Editor, saved changes, restart Data Acq, restart DSMs 304 and 305, signal goes form 2 to 4 but is still about 1.1V. Restored Config to original & saved, restart everything, output back to ch2 but still about 1.1V. Apply 5V on ch2 of patch panel, TestA2D = about 1.1V. Reconnected GNI, sat down at ADS station to contempate next move, watched TestA2D go from about 1.1 to 3.149V, time is about 11:30AM. Note: CAVT_GNI and CAVRH_GNI nan. Calculated expected value for CAVP_GNI from RAF weather station, s/b =3.160V. TestA2D within expected limits. Although I took lots of actions, I don't think any of them fixed the problem. Kept lead techs informed, will inform Chris. JAM

defective card?    A2D019.dat

channel: 3 level: 10v
Internal uncalibrated voltage measures as 8.5397v (DSM 304 RSTB)
An analog test showed this to be questionable...

19Dec2017 GNI variables, CAVP_GNI = about 500mbar. V= about 2.2V, s/b about 3.5V. Continuing previous troubleshooting from 14Dec. Power cycle DSM304. Switch on card cal voltages using A2DTest, reads correctly in Aeros and A2DTest. Connect twinax T and monitor with DMM. Vdmm = about 3.5V, CAVP_GNI = 2.02V. Problem is between patch panel and switch on A2D card. Will change A2D card next time power is off in MPDB, too dangerous to change with power on. JAM
