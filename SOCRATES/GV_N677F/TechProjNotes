05Dec17 - Ran autocal today, A2D1706 card in nose dsm failed.  Warning messages on chnls 1 and 4.  Also, warning message on A2D019 - chnl 3.
A2D1706 ch 1 250 mV offset, ch 2 60 mV offset, ch 3 130 mV offset, ch 4 is
offscale, ch 5 is offscale, ch 6 40 mV offset.

Reset nose dsm, problem went away, suspect dsm boot error - Ta is happy:)

13 Dec 17  Ran auto A/D calibration.  All channels are okay.  Card S/N 19 Ch 3 has a warning message about the 10V being 8.5v but is still calibrated fine.

14Dec17 Checking GNI varibles, CAVP_GNI = about 500mbar. Not right because I have no trouble breathing. Hard power cycle DSM304, no change. Checked TestA2D, V= about 1.1V, s/b about 3.5V, changing in mV level so not frozen. Looked on all other A2D channels, nothing else near about 3.5V. Checked Vout @ GNI box with multimeter, = about 3.5V. Checked @ patch panel cable, = about 3.5V. Changed channel from 2 to 4 in Config Editor, saved changes, restart Data Acq, restart DSMs 304 and 305, signal goes form 2 to 4 but is still about 1.1V. Restored Config to original & saved, restart everything, output back to ch2 but still about 1.1V. Apply 5V on ch2 of patch panel, TestA2D = about 1.1V. Reconnected GNI, sat down at ADS station to contempate next move, watched TestA2D go from about 1.1 to 3.149V, time is about 11:30AM. Note: CAVT_GNI and CAVRH_GNI nan. Calculated expected value for CAVP_GNI from RAF weather station, s/b =3.160V. TestA2D within expected limits. Although I took lots of actions, I don't think any of them fixed the problem. Kept lead techs informed, will inform Chris. JAM

defective card?    A2D019.dat

19Dec2017 GNI variables, CAVP_GNI = about 500mbar. V= about 2.2V, s/b about 3.5V. Continuing previous troubleshooting from 14Dec. Power cycle DSM304. Switch on card cal voltages using A2DTest, reads correctly in Aeros and A2DTest. Connect twinax T and monitor with DMM. Vdmm = about 3.5V, CAVP_GNI = 2.02V. Problem is between patch panel and switch on A2D card. Will change A2D card next time power is off in MPDB, too dangerous to change with power on. JAM

Takeoff:21:02
Landing:04:11

Start camera icon didn't work.  Had to start_cameras in terminal window.  Cameras stopped recording 23:46 ish.  Restarted.  Again shortly after at 23:52 ish.  Coincidentally during intial descents at that time.  Not sure if it is related.  Have a pic of failure messages in terminal window for SE's. 

No LWO DSM this flight.  Waiting on spare power supply.  This means no Gust Pod.

VCSEL having a hard time holding dewpoint.  Reboot around 21:34.  Reboot didn't do much. Turned out it was going between modes at -20c.  Once we got a little warmer or cooler, it worked fine.  Iced up various times and lost dew point in flight.

PLWC not responding as expected.  Still responding at 7.5W-8.5W ish.  Should be around 14W in clear air.

DPR went wonky around 01:18.  Came back around 01:25.

QCR went nan at 02:25.  Probably iced up or froze some water inside tubing around 02:12.  Came back inline with QCF around 02:39.

Unheated Temp Probe iced up quite a bit through flight.  Not sure if it survived.

2DS V channel not responding well.  I think this has been the case all along.

RF03
Prior to flight, changed out plwc element.  Ohmed out good.  Chris W also lowered the PLWCC calculation lower threshold from 10W to 7W.

Opened up radome and blew out all pressure tubing.  There was water in all the lines.

MAINTENANCE DAY
/Troubleshooting PLWC at board level (Josh) Had to pull 2D-S can to access pylon to remove PLWC Control Box for further inspection/troubleshooting. Cannot test PLWC until flight.
/Inspecting 2D-S optics, internally (Josh)
/Performed CDP Cals
/RWI DSM did not boot right away. Had to cycle breaker three times. Opened pylon cover to let the DSM air out a bit.
/Filled Butanol - RAF CN and CVI CN.
/Air shipment arrived mid-afternoon...*ADS Spares* Installed spare AC/DC Power Supply in LWO DSM. Tests out GOOD.


01Feb2018
MAINTENACE DAY
/Pulled all DSM covers from pylons to allow air flow to DSMs.
/Blew out all nose drain lines from connection at the pressure transducer to the drain, (nose holes taped).
/Performed CDP Cals
/Cleaned DPL. Right Dew Pointer should be cleaned next maintenance day. Did not want to do both at once in case they were damaged.
/Left Camera has a faulty fire-wire connection at the back of the camera. Wiggling it causes the camera to go ON and OFF. Messing with it in flight causes all camera images to fail. May want to leave OFF for rest of project.
/Identified Gust Pod issue. Molex connector PINS on GP power supply (60Hz input) making poor contact. Causing Gust Pod power ON and OFF intermittently. Pulled pins, found them to be inserted upside down, reshaped, and reinstalled. Tested out good.
*Also found that the Gust Pod input power gender was backwards. Power to the probe has male pins.
Note: Given that the problem with the Gust Pod was power related, it is likely that the Serial card previously removed from LWO DSM is still good.
/Flushed L & R Temp Sensors
/Performed A/D Auto Cal - DSM 305; A/D 1706; Ch.5 Offset increased to 0.010
Chris W. looked into the Data Acquisition drops that were experienced in the two (2) previous Research Flights. He was unable to determine any cause or symptom that may be leading to these drops.
/Jorgen took a 5/64" allen wrench from the tech tool bag, with permission, to use on GNI for the duration of the project. The allen wrench needs to be modified (cut down to size) for his specific use.

Left side buss 60 Hz meter is reading 80V. This happened yesterday as we were doing turn over.  Measured left side with meter and it is 115V.  We do not want to tear into it since we do not have spares here.  Will monitor with meter each day.

Had isssue with 2DC prior to flight.  Initially it would not connect to the DSM.  We opened the panel and reset the USB connector which finally got it to connect.  At that point we noticed that we got a runaway probe and it was giving us imamges with regularity but not constant.  Due to time we decide to attempt a quick clean of the optics through the laser hole.  This did clean the errant particle from the 45 degree mirrors. The end diode voltages were higher than I had seen before but we are getting images.  We will clean 
the mirrors correctly before the next flight.

Did not do autocal prior to flight, yesterdays were fine and I ran out of time.

Messed up and deleted my log so I might have missed something

Maintenace Day
Removed 2DC mirrors.  They were still cleaned.  We cleaned them and reinstalled.  In the future we will clean them between each set of flights on a maintenace day but not between consecutive flights inless there is a reason to suspect contamination.
Opened radome and revese blew out QCR since it froze last flight.  Got about 1/8 tsp of water out of the line with the center hole plugged.  Also reverse blew the bottom ADIF port but no water can out.
Opened Gust pod for inspection since QC gust also froze last flight. Found that the center port had water in it, we were able to see the water in the teflon line.  We blew out 2 other ports with no water coming out so we are calling it good at this point.  The wind has come up so we will do the CDP cal and 2DC checks tomorrow.Filled Butonal in our CN counter might need to fill CVI Tomorrow.


2/7/18
Maintenance day
Did CDP cal, looks about the same.  Put spinning disk on 2DC so Jorgan would have some data to look at.  Used water to flush the windows of the CDP and 2DS, using air ject to clear the water.  They look better.
Checked out the data system for next flight in the next few days.
Looked at left camera, we applied contact cleaner and added a strain relief.  Hopefully it will work.  There are not screws at the camera and I think that might be the problem on these rough flights.

With the ferry flights from the last two days we decided to just look at the radome lines.  We found that the center port had a small dropplet of water in drain line.  We opened it and then did a light blow from the center port with the drain open to remove the final condensation.  Closed up the radome after that.

Looked at the 2DC mirrors.  The outboard had a haze and what appeard to be a small water spot on it.  The inboard was clean.  Both mirrors cleaned and re-installed.

0513 Gust probe stopped all variables.  DSM reset. Data restored when rebooted.
0520 Gust probe DSM stopped again, came back at 0522 when I was up resetting breaker. Came back at 0526 and stopped within seconds. It did not come back in 3 to 4 minutes so I pulled the breaker for the rest of the flight.  We will have to look at that before a flight tomorrow.

Preflight - firewall issues
There were issues with the fire wall changes that were made and backed out yesterday. Eventually it was corrected and the off plane communications were restored.

On Taxi the data aquisition stopped again.  It stopped just as we moved from parking. It needed to be restarted once we took off (stop data aquisition and then start data aquisition continuing the same flight and restart NIMBUS). This is the second consecutive flight that this has occurred. Not sure why it would work the whole preflight then fail when the plane moves?

Maintenance Day
Removed DPR for cleaning. Found lots of particles in it, blew it out and cleaned the mirror.  Looking back at data not sure why this one is so noisy at low level.  The balance number is not good at low level for some reason.  If this cleaning does not fix the issues I would suspect that it need to go in for repair with some data. This looks like it has been an issue for the begining of the project.

Did a CDP calibrartion.  Looks like something is differnet at the 10um size, now in bin 4 or 5 instead of bin 6. Ran it twice to be sure and got the same result. All the sizes over 10 look like them might have shifted down a bin size but it is somewhat hard to tel.  Also the conditions on the ramp might be different.

Cleaned 2DC mirrors, they were very clean when removed.  Verified end diode voltages after cleaning.

Opened Radome to check the lines, there was no water in any line that we could see.  This was expected as there had been no indications of iced radome in the last few flights.

Looked at date from RF14 to verify that everything looks okay.

Rebooted data system to check changes that Janine put in for the buffers.  This should fix the random stops.

Should be ready for flight tomorrow.

Pre-flight
Due to rain there were questions about going.  We left covers  on as long as we could.  Raining during preflight
Pre flight Auto Cal is showing GNI Cave P at 11 mv again.  Might want to look at that board when we get back.
Had initial issues getting the UHSAS computer to connect. There was no data and the commit button was flashing. Turns out that I had missed a breaker on the wing so it was not getting power.  If no cennections and the commit is look and see if power is on for the probe.

During Taxi the data system quit taking data again.  Cindy reported a "network error" which means that they are no longer getting data from their DSM.  Upon turing around after takeoff I noticed that the DSM time was increasing but that Nimbus had stopped updating.  Since Cindy was not getting anything from the CVI DSM I decided to stop and restart DAQ. When I hit Stop DAQ Cindy reported that the "Network Error" cleared and she was getting data from the DSM again (note I had NOT restarted our DAQ yet). I restarted DAQ (continuing the same flight) and then restarted Nimbus. The data system started displaying data again.

The PI station had an issue with the headset as did the PM station.  The PM PTT did not work. The PI had wierd issues.  Might need to look at L-6 station where we plug in headset and see if it is okay. We have 3 PTT extensions that all have the PTT not working and at least 1 broke headset so far. Also one extension makes it so the sound is very weak and hard to hear. All have been clearly marked in the galley.

0215 Turned on CN counter, it got missed at the 30 Min checks. Also turned on cameras at this time.
0634 DPR looks better but still does not look great at 500 feet.
1900 Forward camera not updateing so I stopped cameras.  Now no cameras are found and the process will not start.
modprobe: ERROR: could not remove 'firewire_ohci': Device or resource busy is the error message. Hopefully it will clear with a power off if nothing else.  I tried to reset the firewire connector but that did not help.

Preflight

BO 2154
TO 2200

As soon as we moved today Nimbus went to Warning, then stopped and then DSM server went to Warning then Stopped.  In about a min it came back and then it happened again in the same sequence as we took the runway.  When I was able to turn around Nimbus and DSM server were both stopped as was the Camera capture. The Camera Capture did not stop before we took the runway, I suspect it stopped during or just after takeoff.  Once I turned around since I saw DSM server stopped I stopped DAQ and then restarted DAQ and Nimbus.  Not sure if that was the best choice but it did get stuff working again.


2225 Gust pod DSM seems to be dropping in and out. Suspect that it might have gotten wet in the rain a few days ago. Maybe we should have opened it when we were packing.
0159 realized that the 2DS was not started for this flight (not something the tech generaly deals with) Will start it tomorrow it is cold soaked already.
0345 Noticed that CCN's had both quite reporting to the data system.  They were still in but not clicking anymore. Turned them off at this point.
Chris turned off nimbus at some poiont.

Samoa to Kona
Pre-flight
Noticed that I forgot to put the tape on the radome last night and there was evidence that it had rained.  Opened the drain ports on the center and top lines. Gently blew them out to clear and water in the tubes. Turned on 2DS for this flight.  The CCN counters are NOT on for this flight.

BO 2150
TO 2153

2205 LWO DSM stopped again.  I think it is a wet issue.  Do not really have time to troubleshoot on the ferry.  If there is time in Kona I will take a look and amybe blow it out.

2210 Power cycled LWO DSM. The DSM cam back at 2212.

2212 LWO stopped again and then it came back at 2221 and I did nothing.  It has to be some kind of wierd wet power issue. LWO continues to have issues perodically throughout the rest of the flight.

2319 2DC end diodes are down a bit. I am sure it is getting a bit dirty. Mirrors should be ckeaned before it is out away.

0125 Data all probes.

At various times during the flight cycled RWO 28VAI for Chris.  This effected Camers and RICE.

0244 Data syste, stopped on landing.

0241 Landed.
0245 Parked at customs

Pre-flight
Chris is removing the Honeywell Temps since they are causing data issues.  Might be doing something else also.

1915 LWO DSM dropping out again. It continues dropping out occassionally for the whole flight.

Quite flight no other issues to report.

Leave at bottom of log.  Edit above this line.
Things to do when at jeffco.
Look at L-6 ICS headset plug in box and make sure wires are okay.
LWO DSM is dropping out suspect "wet" issues.  It should be gone over including the AC to DC supply
Bottom radiometer, suspect that water is getting in via outer dome then into inner dome via small holes in base.  O-ring looks a little small there is still a gap.  Might want to look at using a gasket.
Head sets and cords need repair.
Look at ADS ICS plug in, not working with remote PPT but it could be that PTT also.
2DC end diode voltages decreasing. Probably should be cleaned before getting put away.

Data Qual
PHIPS look that SEQ_PHIPS in increaseing 1 per second
PIP diodes should be between 1 and 2.5 V
2 DC end Diodes over 1V
RICE about 1V in flight cycleing up to 5V in cicing conditions.
PLWC grater than 10W in flight usually 12W at altitude 16 W low level.
Look at a couple of flights and get information to put in a Data QC file by varibale name.
