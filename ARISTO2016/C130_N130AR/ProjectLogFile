ARISTO 2016 project start upload 06/20/16

New kernal on all DSM's.  

New serial pressure transducers installed.

319 has Digital and Analog cards added to it.

DPT has constant rebalance light.  Since it looks like it is reporting okay and it is clean we will be leaving it for the project.  It will need to go in to be fixed and we are going to wait until the next full project to do that.

UHSAS got hot and needed to be shutdown for a bit. 16:53 to 17:08.
