Between orig and final .txt files, the following were manually changed:

Version1:
Changed 28/1/2010 12:00:08 to 28/1/2010 00:00:08
Changed 30/1/2010 12:00:12 to 31/1/2010 00:00:12
Removed MM/D/YYYY from start of every line.
These data were not 1/sec, so PI sent me interpolated data. These data
were NOT used in the final .nc files.

Version2:
Remove units from header line (molec/cm? should be molec/cm2 and asc2cdf
won't interpret them right anyway).
Change Date_time to Time
Remove "dd.mm.yyyy " from front of line.
