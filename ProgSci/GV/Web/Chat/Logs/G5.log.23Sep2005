[GMT 09/23/05 16:15:54] <MikeDaniels-home> just a sec
[GMT 09/23/05 16:16:54] <MikeDaniels-home> i am helping him connect to xchat

[GMT 09/23/05 16:19:46] <maclean> Chris, I'm here. Mike says the serial sensors aren't talking?
[GMT 09/23/05 16:20:03] <ChrisWebster-GV> Hi
[GMT 09/23/05 16:20:09] <ChrisWebster-GV> correct.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:20:16] <ChrisWebster-GV> I think you mentioned something last night.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:20:39] <maclean> No I don't know why things are not working
[GMT 09/23/05 16:20:43] <maclean> Try this
[GMT 09/23/05 16:20:57] <maclean> rserial /dev/dsmser0 dsm304
[GMT 09/23/05 16:21:32] <MikeDaniels-home> cjw: a reminder: cut and past come in very handy for entering commands and relaying the output

[GMT 09/23/05 16:21:53] <ChrisWebster-GV> and that's it.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:21:53] <maclean> now enter *0100P4
[GMT 09/23/05 16:22:09] <ChrisWebster-GV> streaming output.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:22:15] <maclean> not do ctrl-D
[GMT 09/23/05 16:22:19] <maclean> now do ctrl-D
[GMT 09/23/05 16:22:25] <ChrisWebster-GV> do I need to that for all 4 sensors?
[GMT 09/23/05 16:22:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> done
[GMT 09/23/05 16:22:50] <maclean> Is the GPS working:    do   rserial /dev/dsmser5 dsm304
[GMT 09/23/05 16:23:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> Garmin is working
[GMT 09/23/05 16:23:48] <maclean> Now check the mensors
[GMT 09/23/05 16:23:55] <maclean> rserial /dev/dsmser0 dsm304
[GMT 09/23/05 16:24:14] <ChrisWebster-GV> streaming stuff
[GMT 09/23/05 16:24:30] <maclean> good, you can check dsmser1, 2 and 3
[GMT 09/23/05 16:24:50] <ChrisWebster-GV> nothing on 1
[GMT 09/23/05 16:24:51] <maclean> Oops the mensors are on dsm305, 
[GMT 09/23/05 16:25:02] <maclean> do rserial /dev/dsmser0 dsm305
[GMT 09/23/05 16:25:25] <ChrisWebster-GV> they all stream
[GMT 09/23/05 16:25:40] <maclean> good, so the only one out was the Paro (dsmser0@dsm304)?
[GMT 09/23/05 16:25:48] <ChrisWebster-GV> can I restart dsm_server & nimbus now?
[GMT 09/23/05 16:25:58] <maclean> You shouldn't need to
[GMT 09/23/05 16:26:04] <maclean> You should see data
[GMT 09/23/05 16:26:19] <ChrisWebster-GV> there was no QCR QCF ADIFR or BDIFR 
[GMT 09/23/05 16:26:47] <ChrisWebster-GV> Those 4 variables weren't even showing up in the database which means dsm_Server didn't hand them to me...
[GMT 09/23/05 16:26:59] <maclean> wierd
[GMT 09/23/05 16:27:14] <maclean> Let's see if they're being archived:  
[GMT 09/23/05 16:27:21] <maclean> do    data_stats sock:hyper
[GMT 09/23/05 16:27:28] <maclean> then after 10 seconds, ctrl-C
[GMT 09/23/05 16:28:06] <ChrisWebster-GV> nothing other than some startup meta-data
[GMT 09/23/05 16:28:15] <maclean> OK, lets start dsm_server
[GMT 09/23/05 16:28:17] <ChrisWebster-GV> oh wait

[GMT 09/23/05 16:33:08] <MikeDaniels-home> you will need to repeat that msg.  i am trying to get him to reconnect to &G5
[GMT 09/23/05 16:33:24] <maclean> We're getting the Mensors.  Perhaps you only need to restart nimbus
[GMT 09/23/05 16:33:57] <maclean> Try restarting nimbus.  I don't think you need to restart dsm_server
[GMT 09/23/05 16:34:33] <ChrisBurghart-GV> CW is away at the moment, but I'll let him know.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:34:37] <maclean> data_stats showed that you're getting all the serial sensors
[GMT 09/23/05 16:34:52] <maclean> what's hypers IP address?

[GMT 09/23/05 16:37:37] <ChrisWebster-GV> We have a database mismatch.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:39:18] <maclean> I logged in and did a data_stats dsm_20050923_134041.ads
[GMT 09/23/05 16:40:00] <maclean> It shows that we have all the data since the beginning of the flight
[GMT 09/23/05 16:40:59] <maclean> so no need to panic
[GMT 09/23/05 16:45:09] <maclean> Mike: seems like we need to adjust the flood parameter.  If someone does a cut/paste of 20 lines they get kicked off
[GMT 09/23/05 16:46:32] <ChrisWebster-GV> I love databases.  I can just go i with psql and hand fix things.
[GMT 09/23/05 16:51:41] <MikeDaniels-home> gordon: i can look into it.  looks like it was the bot that kicked him off, not the server which is interesting
[GMT 09/23/05 16:52:34] <MikeDaniels-home> there is another setting that might be useful: kick any user named ChrisWebster* whenever he joins ;-)
[GMT 09/23/05 16:53:32] <maclean> I'm still logged in to hyper.  Can I fetch/install the tetris rpm?
[GMT 09/23/05 16:54:51] <MikeDaniels-home> i found the config line.  how many lines should we allow?
[GMT 09/23/05 16:55:08] <maclean> More seriously:  I just checked the system logs.  I see no indication of  spikes on the dsm304 A2D
[GMT 09/23/05 16:55:16] <MikeDaniels-home> just to take care of the accidental flood
[GMT 09/23/05 16:55:17] <maclean> What is the current setting?

[GMT 09/23/05 17:11:54] <ChrisWebster-GV> we need to restart it with the new IP addr, forgot to put on in.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:12:09] <ChrisWebster-GV> we need to wait until 18 minutes past the hour.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:12:17] <ChrisWebster-GV> db is fine.  I hand entered the fixes.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:12:46] <ChrisWebster-GV> problem was when blocking/q'ing up SQL commands, if any command fails, they all fail.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:12:59] <ChrisWebster-GV> I added the 'blocking' last night.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:19:32] <ChrisWebster-GV> $85 million and there are no cup holders?!?!?!?!???
[GMT 09/23/05 17:20:13] <maclean> You can use the AVAPS drop tube once it's installed
[GMT 09/23/05 17:20:36] <MikeDaniels-home> whaddaya think those facny racks are for?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:20:52] <MikeDaniels-home> who didn't design a cupholder in them or the seats?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:21:42] <maclean> You need one of those Bud-lite hats that football fans wear
[GMT 09/23/05 17:21:51] <MikeDaniels-home> for sure :-)
[GMT 09/23/05 17:22:47] <MikeDaniels-home> fwiw, i checked the logs and there is nothing obvious wrt floods
[GMT 09/23/05 17:23:09] <MikeDaniels-home> i wonder what they mean by "lines" though.  is 20 lines 20*80 characters or something less?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:24:18] <MikeDaniels-home> the config file also refers to "partylines" which i don't udnerstand
[GMT 09/23/05 17:24:22] <MikeDaniels-home> here is the text:
[GMT 09/23/05 17:24:32] <maclean> You could try up-ing it to something big like 200 to see if you're adjusting the right thing

[GMT 09/23/05 17:24:47] <MikeDaniels-home> oops, sorry about that
[GMT 09/23/05 17:24:59] <MikeDaniels-home> yea, i could try that
[GMT 09/23/05 17:25:27] <MikeDaniels-home> that should have been a flood if it was still 5 lines, no?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:25:40] <maclean> perhaps
[GMT 09/23/05 17:26:41] <MikeDaniels-home> let me try to set it to 200
[GMT 09/23/05 17:26:56] <maclean> I don't see any sql*.gz files in malbec:~ldm/data/files.  Should there be some?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:27:17] <ChrisWebster-GV> not sure, I tell it to go directly into a pipe.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:27:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> I' going to psql into orion
[GMT 09/23/05 17:27:49] <MikeDaniels-home> this time i kill -HUP 'ed -- try when you like
[GMT 09/23/05 17:29:20] <maclean> OK here's another flood
[GMT 09/23/05 17:29:30] <MikeDaniels-home> wait!
[GMT 09/23/05 17:29:39] <maclean> I'm waiting
[GMT 09/23/05 17:29:40] <MikeDaniels-home> just found another config
[GMT 09/23/05 17:30:20] <MikeDaniels-home> says how many messages in how many seconds constitutes a flood
[GMT 09/23/05 17:30:24] <MikeDaniels-home> was set to 5/60
[GMT 09/23/05 17:30:31] <MikeDaniels-home> 5 msgs in 60 seconds
[GMT 09/23/05 17:30:31] <maclean> Perhaps we should test this on a local-only group.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:30:54] <maclean> I'll be we exceed that quite often
[GMT 09/23/05 17:30:58] <MikeDaniels-home> but then for sure mine was a flood
[GMT 09/23/05 17:31:02] <MikeDaniels-home> too
[GMT 09/23/05 17:32:00] <MikeDaniels-home> so even though i'm not sure about that one, you can send 20 lines now

[GMT 09/23/05 17:35:07] <ChrisWebster-GV> why?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:35:32] <ChrisWebster-GV> ldmadmin watch is showing stuff arriving.

[GMT 09/23/05 17:36:27] <ChrisWebster-GV> no, I'll restart it.  you need to be ldm
[GMT 09/23/05 17:36:45] <maclean> your entry in pqact.conf was ^sql_(\.gz)$  which won't match your files.  It should work now
[GMT 09/23/05 17:37:46] <maclean> Does you exec_sql script need a file name?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:38:03] <ChrisWebster-GV> oh.  What is that file again?  I thought we were on ldmd.conf
[GMT 09/23/05 17:38:17] <ChrisWebster-GV> exec_sql will get a pipe input.
[GMT 09/23/05 17:39:00] <maclean> I see that now.  I made a change to pqact.conf on ~ldm/etc
[GMT 09/23/05 17:39:07] <MikeDaniels-home> you can try flooding whenever you are ready
[GMT 09/23/05 17:41:39] <maclean> It might be wise to use FILE instead of PIPE in pqact.conf, and pass the file name to your script in the same way as is done with the png files.

[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:01] <MikeDaniels-home> but, you're right, we can do this later
[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:03] <MikeDaniels-home> that just cost 100 bones
[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:05] <MikeDaniels-home> and should have been done in another room
[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:07] <MikeDaniels-home> where hiaper was not connected.  oops
[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:09] <MikeDaniels-home> we will learn to think about such things
[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:38] <maclean> 5.7 cents / kbyte right - that didn't cost too much
[GMT 09/23/05 17:46:44] <MikeDaniels-home> but i did not get kicked for some reason
[GMT 09/23/05 17:47:00] <maclean> did you cut/paste the whole thing?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:47:17] <MikeDaniels-home> yes, i'm just being facetious
[GMT 09/23/05 17:47:23] <MikeDaniels-home> yes, cut and paste
[GMT 09/23/05 17:47:35] <MikeDaniels-home> on my client it just zipped by, too
[GMT 09/23/05 17:48:11] <maclean> did my dumps display quickly?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:48:23] <MikeDaniels-home> no, they were jerky
[GMT 09/23/05 17:48:26] <ChrisWebster-GV> no
[GMT 09/23/05 17:48:55] <ChrisWebster-GV> how do I clear an ldm Q?  and reset?
[GMT 09/23/05 17:49:06] <maclean> I dunno
[GMT 09/23/05 17:56:34] pavel-jeffco (pavel@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left &G5 (Leaving).
[GMT 09/23/05 18:03:52] <maclean> I see in hyper:/var/log/messages that ldm is doing something every minute
[GMT 09/23/05 18:04:46] <maclean> How do I check things here.  ~ldm/logs/ldmd.log on malbec doesn't show anything useful
[GMT 09/23/05 18:04:48] <ChrisWebster-GV> stuff is coming down, we have some permissions thingy with ldm & psql, looking inot it.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:05:35] <maclean> Should I change PIPE to FILE and make the other changes so at least we can see the files?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:06:03] <ChrisWebster-GV> ok, everything works fine when I run the script on malbec, but when 'ldm' runs it we get:
[GMT 09/23/05 18:06:05] <ChrisWebster-GV> 19 malbec:/home/ldm-> cat ~cjw/junk.gz  | ~cjw/bin/exec_sql
[GMT 09/23/05 18:06:05] <ChrisWebster-GV> my_psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
[GMT 09/23/05 18:06:05] <ChrisWebster-GV>         Is the server running locally and accepting
[GMT 09/23/05 18:06:05] <ChrisWebster-GV>         connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:08:10] <maclean> You're not exporting the PG variables in your exec_sql script,  add   export at the beginning of the PG...= lines
[GMT 09/23/05 18:08:24] <maclean> export PGHOST=orion.atd.ucar.edu   etc
[GMT 09/23/05 18:09:04] <maclean> I can do it here
[GMT 09/23/05 18:10:17] <ChrisWebster-GV> we noticed.  done.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:10:21] <maclean> I see you made the change, but you exported DATABASE not PGDATABASE
[GMT 09/23/05 18:10:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> no I need to flush the Q here so I can re-transmit all the files....
[GMT 09/23/05 18:10:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> now not no
[GMT 09/23/05 18:18:28] <ChrisWebster-GV> Gordon, do an 'ldmadmin watch' on malbec and ensure stuff is coming down, I don't want all that text coming back up here
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:05] <maclean> I'm watching.  (had to set LDMHOME to ~ldm first) . Nothing yet
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> we might need to expire things on the ground.  we did it up here and cleared our Q
[GMT 09/23/05 18:23:55] <maclean> Perhaps I need to restart ldmd with the changes to pqact.conf?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:25:23] <ChrisWebster-GV> Didn't I restart it after you made that change?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:25:47] <maclean> Not sure.  I wonder if we can have both a FILE and PIPE for a given product?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:18] <maclean> I just restarted it
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:37] <ChrisWebster-GV> I think so.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:26:54] <ChrisWebster-GV> I'm about to resend everything, I expired Q on both ends.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:27:29] <ChrisWebster-GV> we're at 51,000'

[GMT 09/23/05 18:28:49] <ChrisWebster-GV> do the ldmadmin watch command again
[GMT 09/23/05 18:28:59] <ChrisWebster-GV> rita is at the horizon
[GMT 09/23/05 18:29:15] <maclean> ldadmin is showing things

[GMT 09/23/05 18:30:22] <pavel-jeffco> Jim - they are probably surfing the web and can see it themselves, with that hi-speed access...
[GMT 09/23/05 18:30:22] <ChrisWebster-GV> Are you seeing the files down there?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:31:56] <JimMoore-Ops> pavel-jeffco, Oh please!?!
[GMT 09/23/05 18:32:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> actually we can, I'm doing Email, chat, google and eBay.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:33:09] <maclean> I don't see the files in data/files
[GMT 09/23/05 18:33:13] <pavel-jeffco> Ok, I am talking to Gerry - the cost of this uptime is on Chris.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:33:23] <JimMoore-Ops> ChrisWebster-GV, Yea well, maybe we can just keep the )(&(%%$ phones on NRL alive for another 6 hours!!
[GMT 09/23/05 18:36:23] <ChrisWebster-GV> our connection has been rock solid for both flights, but we stay in one area, so we haven'
[GMT 09/23/05 18:36:31] <MikeDaniels-home> we were saying yesterday that ll of us need to learn the new IM lingo in order to save money
[GMT 09/23/05 18:36:36] <ChrisWebster-GV> t experienced satellite transfers.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:36:46] <MikeDaniels-home> u know, how r u?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:38:42] <pavel-jeffco> yeah, g2g, p i h - that sort of thing?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:39:02] <MikeDaniels-home> dude!
[GMT 09/23/05 18:39:48] <maclean> Chris, I see files now.  I did a ldmadmin pqactHUP which may have help things.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:39:58] <maclean> Is stuff getting to the data base?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:40:04] <ChrisWebster-GV> how many?  I just expired my Q
[GMT 09/23/05 18:40:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> no, nothing in database
[GMT 09/23/05 18:40:36] <maclean> sequence 932 to 1088
[GMT 09/23/05 18:40:51] <maclean> Now that we have the files we can do things by hand
[GMT 09/23/05 18:42:12] <ChrisWebster-GV> agreed.  seems like ground ops now.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:42:18] <ChrisWebster-GV> how many files did you get?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:43:15] <ChrisWebster-GV> It's getting cold.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:43:20] <maclean> we have 188 now
[GMT 09/23/05 18:43:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> is it growing or stopped?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:43:33] <maclean> actually 186
[GMT 09/23/05 18:44:14] <maclean> It is stopped now, last file was sql_sequence01117.gz
[GMT 09/23/05 18:46:19] <ChrisWebster-GV> So that should by 1117 files not 186.....
[GMT 09/23/05 18:47:15] <maclean> For some reason they started at sql_sequence00932.gz
[GMT 09/23/05 18:47:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> pppphhhtttt.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:47:53] <ChrisWebster-GV> should start at 00000
[GMT 09/23/05 18:48:29] <maclean> Should I pipe some through your /h/9/cjw/bin/exec_sql command?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:49:29] <ChrisWebster-GV> You need all the first ones to set the database up.  But you could try it to see what kind of error you get....
[GMT 09/23/05 18:50:12] <ChrisWebster-GV> Also all the sql*.gz files are saved on the plane.  We can retransmit any time.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:50:25] <ChrisWebster-GV> We should get them on the ground, then hand try to execute the script.

[GMT 09/23/05 18:53:35] <maclean> OK
[GMT 09/23/05 18:53:53] <ChrisWebster-GV> You shouldn't have any files now....  unless expire doesn't scrub them.

[GMT 09/23/05 18:57:45] <ChrisWebster-GV> ok, those appeared to work.
[GMT 09/23/05 18:57:56] <ChrisWebster-GV> Why won't ldm pipe them correctly?
[GMT 09/23/05 18:58:01] <ChrisWebster-GV> Sending next 100
[GMT 09/23/05 18:59:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> you should be getting them
[GMT 09/23/05 18:59:36] <maclean> I see them
[GMT 09/23/05 18:59:52] <maclean> How do I check the data base - perhaps it's working now
[GMT 09/23/05 19:00:59] <ChrisWebster-GV> I just use psql and see if things are changing.
[GMT 09/23/05 19:01:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> setenv PGHOST orion.atd.ucar.edu, PGUSER ads, PGDATABASE real-time ; psql

[GMT 09/23/05 19:04:13] <maclean> I haven't piped in any files, I had hoped that sending the things starting from 0 would work.
[GMT 09/23/05 19:04:21] <maclean> I can pipe them though
