[GMT 12/03/05 00:31:38] <GordonMaclean-GV> done
[GMT 12/03/05 00:31:57] <cjw> ok, I'll start ldm once I've gotten through 1999
[GMT 12/03/05 00:37:49] <cjw> ok, I started the ldm, did it connect?
[GMT 12/03/05 00:38:00] <cjw> yup, we have products
[GMT 12/03/05 00:38:31] <JorgenJensen-GV> Dropsonde number 1 released; good signal strength, but no data. Will evaluate, but most likely suspend releases until we can inspect the aircraft.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:39:14] <cjw> wow, ldm moves stuff way faster than scp.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:43:19] <GordonMaclean-GV> For the record, 24V power supply out on chaps rack so no data from qcrake,psrake,pcone
[GMT 12/03/05 00:44:10] <GordonMaclean-GV> This also effects some analog channels - not sure which ones
[GMT 12/03/05 00:44:40] <JorgenJensen-GV> We are having problems with the HF radio contact to ATC; will attempt to use sat phone to dial Oakland; if that fails, then we will have to return.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:45:45] <Cowan-Home> Did the 28V supply burn up?  Is there a breaker on that?
[GMT 12/03/05 00:46:02] <GordonMaclean-GV> I'll have Dave or Greg answer that...
[GMT 12/03/05 00:47:08] <ads-G5> John, it's David.  There is no breaker on the 28vdc vicor power supplies
[GMT 12/03/05 00:47:54] <ads-G5> I happened to have a volt meter and Greg and I checked the output... 0.00
[GMT 12/03/05 00:48:07] <ads-G5> Input is good
[GMT 12/03/05 00:48:32] <Cowan-Home> That's what I thought.  Is it plugged in still. I'm just trying to get an idea on whats happened.  I was thinking that those supplies should be pretty stable and not fail on us.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:48:59] <Cowan-Home> Okay.  I guess that will needd to get fixed.  I can do that tomorrow.\
[GMT 12/03/05 00:49:12] <ads-G5> That is what I thought too
[GMT 12/03/05 00:50:44] <ads-G5> It is a 500 Watt supply.  We do have another already built up in the drawer in my lab.  It looks like an easy swap
[GMT 12/03/05 00:51:05] ads__ (ads@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:52:05] <Cowan-Home> Okay.  You have also lost all the rake data since the pressure scanner also is powered off of that supply.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:52:56] <ads-G5> That is correct
[GMT 12/03/05 00:53:42] <ads-G5> As well as some other pieces of equipment... I imagine that the rake is the big one
[GMT 12/03/05 00:54:14] <RonRuth-BJC> away
[GMT 12/03/05 00:54:59] <ads-G5> I may be able to rip the power supply apart Monday and figure out where it has gone bad.  Until then we will just have to swap it out.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:56:24] <ads-G5> We may want to think about using one of those pico fuses that you have in the power plug until we can install a more permanent fix.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:57:04] <Cowan-Home> OKay,  We will see what we can do tomorrow.  I left Kurt a message since he might want to get someone else in to help out if there are any more problems.
[GMT 12/03/05 00:58:50] <ads-G5> I am available to come in a little later tomorrow, if need be
[GMT 12/03/05 01:00:20] <Cowan-Home> I'll be back about 2100 local. I'm staying online so that I can review the log when I get back.
[GMT 12/03/05 01:09:04] <Cowan-Home> Try to cycle power on the supply.  Later
[GMT 12/03/05 01:09:40] <ads-G5> Already tried that... No good
[GMT 12/03/05 01:10:54] <JorgenJensen-GV> Attention: Dean just told me that the dropsonde is still transmitting; it should have stopped a while ago. Furthermore, it is transmitting GPS data from OUR ALTITUDE. Conclusion, it is hanging somewhere on the outside of the aircraft. Pilots have been notified.

[GMT 12/03/05 03:08:02] <JorgenJensen-GV> Yes, pretty isolated here, but a great spitit onboard. Lots of tech talk, lots of looking and predicting the tropopause. We are doing almost a mirror image on the return, but obviously without the sun exposure affecting new particle formation. The little critters observed on the way out may already have been scavenged, and there may be now new ones in ther place.
[GMT 12/03/05 03:10:14] <MikeDaniels-home> Jorgen, that is great.  I am going to try to monitor your track with google earth.
[GMT 12/03/05 03:12:12] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> gordon - can you join me in the tab I just sent you?
[GMT 12/03/05 03:12:34] <SHANHU_G5> This is a great experiments to test sun effects.  We are following exactly the same tracks; bu the air has mixed, so small particle concentrations will be different.  I cannot predict lower or higher their concentrations, depending on mixing.  Also, by the time, we reach Coloraodo, the air should be very different from the ones we saw on the way to here.

[GMT 12/03/05 03:45:21] <MikeDaniels-home> flight rf02, right?
[GMT 12/03/05 03:45:27] <MikeDaniels-home> i will double check
[GMT 12/03/05 03:45:54] <ChrisWebster-mobil> the mag glass goes after the database which is the current flight, no matter what flight you click.
[GMT 12/03/05 03:46:52] <MikeDaniels-home> javascript enabled

[GMT 12/03/05 03:56:21] <MikeDaniels-home> that image file was from google earth, wasn't it?

[GMT 12/03/05 03:56:46] <MikeDaniels-home> yes

[GMT 12/03/05 04:16:44] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> chris - I found that I can select m or ft. in GoogleEarth. So perhaps you should go back to sending the altitude in meters.

[GMT 12/03/05 04:21:34] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I tried to send you a file. It might have tmed out; I'll try again.

[GMT 12/03/05 04:24:24] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> that's what it says on my side also. The only succesful chat file xfer that we have had has been from my XP machine at home to whatever machine Mike is using right now. Any other combination has failed. It has something to do with settings/firewalls I think.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:25:04] <ChrisWebster-mobil> ???  Weird, aren't we all inside the firewall with vpn?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:25:19] <AlCooper-home> Hello Jorgen; just curious, how did it go? Looks as if you're on the way back.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:25:34] <Cowan-Home> I'm back from the concert. Also Ch. 2 is predicting snow for after midnight.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:26:26] <MikeDaniels-home> i see the track now, in google earth on a "virtual pc
[GMT 12/03/05 04:26:28] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Well, I guess so. But maybe it has something to do with the ports for the DCC trasnfer getting through all of the connections?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:26:29] <MikeDaniels-home> window
[GMT 12/03/05 04:27:08] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Is that a virtual pc on the mac? Is it pretty responsive?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:27:19] <MikeDaniels-home> yes and no
[GMT 12/03/05 04:27:22] <MikeDaniels-home> respectively
[GMT 12/03/05 04:27:23] <JorgenJensen-GV> Hi Al, I was off for a while giving a crash course in skew-T disgrams. Actually the flight went very well, but we got a dropsonde stuck halfway in the tube; hope it will stay there until we ate at the hangar.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:28:15] <MikeDaniels-home> so we did not have any satcom dropouts eiter, correct?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:28:39] <GordonMaclean-GV> Nope
[GMT 12/03/05 04:28:47] <ChrisWebster-mobil> I don't believe so.  Better coverage in the central pacific then the central plains????
[GMT 12/03/05 04:29:01] <GordonMaclean-GV> No dropouts
[GMT 12/03/05 04:29:18] <JorgenJensen-GV> Weatherwise it was reasonably well flown. The tropopause in the southern part was lower than where we could go. The HF radio is bad (maybe our instruments/ maybe a bad units). QWe had to use sat phone for ATC comms. No New particle flight on Monday; we need to be in VFR range, and we need some testing of radio/our instruments for interference.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:29:59] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Does that mean no 3:30am take off?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:30:25] <JorgenJensen-GV> We flew quite well around the tropopause, but there were at times many ill-defined clouds, fibrous layers, etc. at our level. Maybe that will complicate the fine particle analysis due to shattering of ice particles.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:30:55] <AlCooper-home> Jorgen, sounds good. It's quite impressive to be able to see your measurements from here at my home in Nederland. Did you have any successful dropsondes before the stuck one?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:31:46] <JorgenJensen-GV> Correct, no 3:30 AM take-off on Monday. Some repairs/checking tonight with our research power off, maybe repairs tomorrow, maybe Monday morning, then a day-time flight on Monday, at best.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:32:25] <JorgenJensen-GV> No after the one sonde was struck, we abandoned putting any further out. We noticed that GPS kept transmitting, BUT THE ALTITUDE DID NOT CHANGE!
[GMT 12/03/05 04:32:31] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Mike & Charlie & Gordon, I checked out the xchat->preferneces->FileTransfer section, mine is pretty blank, Mike how does yours look?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:32:41] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Thanks Jorgen.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:33:23] <JorgenJensen-GV> I will have to update the hotline tonight after we land. Still a maintenance day tomorrow.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:33:55] <MikeDaniels-home> just a sec
[GMT 12/03/05 04:34:01] <JorgenJensen-GV> BTW, many thanks to all the software people on the ground for working so hard during the flight! I look forward to an update on Monday.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:34:10] <ChrisWebster-mobil> 10-4 on maint day, I'll come in and run the data in the morning.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:34:13] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, will one tech be enough for tomorrow?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:34:27] <GordonMaclean-GV> My Xchat file xfer settings are minimal too.  I've tried setting DCC IP addr to the satcom address of hyper, but no joy.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:34:32] <JorgenJensen-GV> Standby, John

[GMT 12/03/05 04:36:33] <MikeDaniels-home> i think you need your swcc ip addr to be the same

[GMT 12/03/05 04:36:52] <MikeDaniels-home> dcc, not swcc
[GMT 12/03/05 04:36:54] <MikeDaniels-home> is the 12.42 addr HIAPER?

[GMT 12/03/05 04:37:10] <ChrisWebster-mobil> yes 12. is hiaper
[GMT 12/03/05 04:37:31] <MikeDaniels-home> i can try an xfer w/gordon then
[GMT 12/03/05 04:37:36] <ChrisWebster-mobil> ok
[GMT 12/03/05 04:38:03] <ChrisWebster-mobil> AlCooper-home what ware you using to view data?  Are you vpn'd in?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:38:25] <MikeDaniels-home> gordon, can you try a dcc send?

[GMT 12/03/05 04:39:31] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> can you see vegas?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:39:46] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Uh oh, the GV looks like it's about to land in Las Vegas....
[GMT 12/03/05 04:39:51] <MikeDaniels-home> gordon, your dcc ip should be 128.117.65.29
[GMT 12/03/05 04:39:53] <Cowan-Home> Greg, Are you going to call Kurt when you get back?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:40:36] <GordonMaclean-GV> OK, hold on
[GMT 12/03/05 04:40:50] <MikeDaniels-home> ok
[GMT 12/03/05 04:41:21] <GordonMaclean-GV> the tip says the  DCC IP  is used when offering files.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:41:27] <JorgenJensen-GV> I think that one tech is probably enough - we discussed it; we should look at the HF radio interference, maybe that is ours, maybe a defective unit.

[GMT 12/03/05 04:41:56] <AlCooper-home> Chris, I'm running aeros and vpn. Seems close to up-to-date, and quite practical. Tried ION but didn't see anything (but I never used it before so maybe don't know how)
[GMT 12/03/05 04:42:18] GordonMaclean-GV (ads@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:42:22] <JorgenJensen-GV> We still have issues with DSM 306; first reboot problems, then the blown 500W powersupply in the CHAPS rack; maybe related? 
[GMT 12/03/05 04:42:28] <ads_GV> (David) I can't imagine that Kurt needs a phone call at midnight...  Greg says he will call Kurt's work phone and leave him a quick message.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:42:41] <ads_GV> Kosher???
[GMT 12/03/05 04:42:57] <JorgenJensen-GV> Saturday would be a good time to look at the CHAPS rack/DSM from both an electrical and software side.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:43:23] <JorgenJensen-GV> On the other hand, Monday should be a more reasonable day for most staff.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:43:31] <Cowan-Home> ads_GV, That's okay and I'll call Kurt in the morning about the HF issues.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:43:33] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Janet has a new mechanism for ION, which got installed right before she went on vacation, so may need some vet'ing.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:43:51] <MikeDaniels-home> can google maps do everything ion can and more, though?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:43:57] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Al, try the GoogleMap:  http://www3/rt_flights/main.php
[GMT 12/03/05 04:44:03] <JorgenJensen-GV> Well, Al Cooper could look at data from hist house in Nederland
[GMT 12/03/05 04:45:03] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, I understand that Al didn't use ION.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:46:24] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, HF testing would require the plane to be outside tomorrow and 2 inches of snow is expected tonight.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:47:31] <MikeDaniels-home> will there be some way to playback this google earth data?  or should i be doing screen shots right now!?!?  it is so cool
[GMT 12/03/05 04:47:36] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Jorgen, my response was to Al....  Mike, yes I believe it does everything ION does.  GoogleMap right now only has 8 variables, we're in demonstration phase.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:48:14] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Though I realize once we demonstrate something, it's expected production the following week.  :)
[GMT 12/03/05 04:48:16] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Not bad considering that you only thought of it a few days ago...-)
[GMT 12/03/05 04:48:45] <AlCooper-home> ChrisWebster-mobil I don't get anything at that URL; is it right?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:49:00] Nick change: SHANHU_G5 -> TeresaCampos-GV
[GMT 12/03/05 04:49:00] <JorgenJensen-GV> We hope to do a simple test tonight. After the plane comes to a halt, then have two minutes with power to get a good diffGPS fix. Then turn research power off, and have the pilots try the HF radio transmission. If it works well for them, then need to work on isolating which of our equipment creates the interference. If HF doesn't work, then we should get a repair on Monday.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:49:15] <ChrisWebster-mobil> AlCooper-home no you should get a GoogleMap with the flight track on it.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:49:44] <MikeDaniels-home> he might need www3.atd :-)
[GMT 12/03/05 04:49:51] <MikeDaniels-home> or www3.atd.ucar.edu
[GMT 12/03/05 04:50:04] <MikeDaniels-home> al, can you try those also?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:50:06] <ChrisWebster-mobil> AlCooper-home try http://www3.atd.ucar.edu/rt_flights/main.php
[GMT 12/03/05 04:50:13] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Also try adding a # after nain.php
[GMT 12/03/05 04:50:16] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, sounds good. It would be good if the results of this was included in the phone message to Kurt.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:50:22] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Also try adding a # after main.php
[GMT 12/03/05 04:50:38] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, will do.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:51:00] <ads_GV> Yes John we will handle it. Greg
[GMT 12/03/05 04:51:52] <Cowan-Home> ads_GV, Thanks didn't mean to stick my nose in it, just wanted to make sure we had enough coverage for tomorrow. Also I know Kurt will be very interested if there's a problem with our equipment.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:53:08] <ads_GV> I'll probably swing by for a bit, the power supply shouldn't take more than an hour to change
[GMT 12/03/05 04:53:12] <MikeDaniels-home> btw, i also had to change the kml file to reference www3.atd.ucar.edu instead of www3, of course
[GMT 12/03/05 04:53:17] <MikeDaniels-home> for google earth
[GMT 12/03/05 04:54:03] <Cowan-Home> ads_GV, Okay, your option, but I could probably handle it if you get tied up and don't want to come in. It is a long drive for an hour of work.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:54:07] <ChrisWebster-mobil> So Mike, I think it's time to proxy this outside.  I talked to Santiago the other, their big concern about security is any webpage that does Email or has user input/entry.  This has neither...
[GMT 12/03/05 04:54:26] <MikeDaniels-home> sounds fine to me
[GMT 12/03/05 04:55:09] <ads_GV> I'll be down in Denver anyway and cna also call kurt in the morn.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:55:31] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Then in the short term the GV can use that page for some map/track data.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:55:36] <Cowan-Home> ads_GV, Whatever you decide is fine with me.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:55:49] <AlCooper-home> ChrisWebster-mobil Now I see a blank screen that says "map" but I don't get anything there. (Tried clicking the listed flights.) I got some kind of message about a key needed. (But I'm happy to see the aeros map, unless you're asking me to help debug something?)
[GMT 12/03/05 04:56:04] <Cowan-Home> Both techs: Looks like you both are doing a great job. Thanks!
[GMT 12/03/05 04:56:21] <MikeDaniels-home> now click on a magnifying glass for rf02
[GMT 12/03/05 04:56:58] <MikeDaniels-home> are you descending?
[GMT 12/03/05 04:57:03] <ChrisWebster-mobil> AlCooper-home no debugging required, just wanted you to chack out our web flight track thing.  I'll have to work on that 'key' thing.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:57:52] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Charlie did you do anything about the 'key' thing in GoogleMap.  I know I did it, but I actually entered the key into the php code and have had no problems since...
[GMT 12/03/05 04:58:36] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I didn't have to do anything that I recall, but perhaps you can tell Al what to do. It is worth seeing.
[GMT 12/03/05 04:59:27] <AlCooper-home> MikeDaniels-home I did that, but the map stayed blank
[GMT 12/03/05 05:00:02] <MikeDaniels-home> al gets the same results i do, then
[GMT 12/03/05 05:03:11] <MikeDaniels-home> gordon, i get no such dcc offer
[GMT 12/03/05 05:03:44] <MikeDaniels-home> everybody.  i've got to go.  glad to see things are going well -- see you monday!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:03:52] <ChrisWebster-mobil> I'm looking at the google/apis/maps site now.  The key it seems for the web page ....  still scanning it...
[GMT 12/03/05 05:04:03] MikeDaniels-home (daniels@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 12/03/05 05:05:14] <ChrisWebster-mobil> I think the problem is that the key is generated for www3/rt_flights, so anyone who has to type in www3.atd it won't work.  I'll get a new key.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:07:40] <ChrisWebster-mobil> AlCooper-home try the website now  http://www3.atd.ucar.edu/rt_flights
[GMT 12/03/05 05:08:58] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> good sleuthing - that seems to have been the problem. At least I had to change my URL to www3.atd.ucar.edu.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:09:33] <JorgenJensen-GV> I think that we should plan to have 1 tech, 1 mech and 1 software person to look at problems tomorrow. Different peoples needs are:
[GMT 12/03/05 05:09:55] <ChrisWebster-mobil> ya but I get no track now, how about you?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:10:39] <JorgenJensen-GV> Teresa: Remove CO, work on it on the bench. If all goes well, then re-install in the afternoon. If more problems, then re-install Monday AM.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:10:40] <AlCooper-home> ChrisWebster-mobil Yes, I get a good background map now. How to I get flight data on it? (Tried clicking mag glasses)
[GMT 12/03/05 05:10:59] <JorgenJensen-GV> DCRogers: work for 3 hours on fixing CN.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:11:19] <JorgenJensen-GV> Shanhu: Only data access to netcdf file.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:11:56] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> ditto for me - track is missing. I wonder if www3 is mentioned somewhere in the web code and needs to be fully qualified?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:11:59] <ChrisWebster-mobil> you should be able to click on where it says 'Flight 2'...
[GMT 12/03/05 05:12:24] <JorgenJensen-GV> Gordon/Chris: data conversion; CHAPS instability
[GMT 12/03/05 05:12:52] <ChrisWebster-mobil> looking...
[GMT 12/03/05 05:12:57] <JorgenJensen-GV> Dean lauritsen: Monday morning discussion
[GMT 12/03/05 05:13:43] <JorgenJensen-GV> Techs: Power supply in CHAPS rack, maybe DSM instability?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:13:46] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> javascrpt console reports: Error: uncaught exception: Permission denied to call method XMLHttpRequest.open
[GMT 12/03/05 05:14:40] <GordonMaclean-GV> Chris, I could copy the raw data file to /jnet after we're in the hangar
[GMT 12/03/05 05:15:31] <JorgenJensen-GV> Many tired people onboard; most cannot/will not show up until 10 AM; Do techs and Mechs still want to be here at 8 AM, or is 10 AM sufficiently early? Can you please comment?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:15:43] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, Techs also need to fix IRS2 problem and MPDB DSM. Will need power off the airplane for the first 30 minutes and then later on to reinstall.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:16:08] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, I'm planning on being there at 0800 to work on DSM.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:16:21] <ChrisWebster-mobil> GordonMaclean-GV tonight?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:16:37] <ChrisWebster-mobil> GordonMaclean-GV if so that would be good, I could process it from home.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:16:43] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, That 2 hour window will allow me to work on the DSM without interruption.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:17:24] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, but please expect that most people onboard will not show up until 10 AM. The main 'late' access person I can see is teresa, and her situation is uncertain until she has the instrument on the bench in her lab.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:18:14] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, That's fine. Are you still planning on shutting down at 1600 or will we need to stay later?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:18:19] <JorgenJensen-GV> We should then keep the 8 AM to 4 PM access; maybe close shop early, maybe not. I'll be in at 10 AM.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:18:46] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, Okay, that works fine for me.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:20:29] <JorgenJensen-GV> Maybe we should also contact Bob Olson to look at the radio issue Saturday, depending on our tests after landing tonight.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:21:20] <AlCooper-home> Jorgen, looks like nice regular waves there. Is it very turbulent? Wave amplitude in WI has been about a m/s or so
[GMT 12/03/05 05:21:45] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, I'm sure that Kurt would also want to be contacted if there is a radio issue since he did the EMI checks initially.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:23:28] <JorgenJensen-GV> It was very turbulent on ascent in a low-level northerly flow. bove a 4-deg sharp inversion it was westerly, but non-turbulent. We have still to descent into the turbulen BL if it is still there. The inversion was at 640 mb on climb-out.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:25:37] <JorgenJensen-GV> There was a clear dry-adiabatic layer below the inversion; then the sharp jump, followed by another dry adiabat afor about 100 mb above the inversion inn the westerly.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:27:27] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, we should let him know. of the results tonight.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:28:46] <JorgenJensen-GV> 350 mb, quite turbulent, bouncing a fair bit.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:28:53] <Cowan-Home> JorgenJensen-GV, Okay, I'll let you deal with that since you'll know the results.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:29:03] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Charlie does google earth still work?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:29:05] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK
[GMT 12/03/05 05:29:38] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> yep, GoogleEarth is working fine. They are just coming up on Mt. Massive.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:31:08] <GordonMaclean-GV> Chris:  Yes I'll copy it tonight.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:31:16] <AlCooper-home> JorgenJensen-GV Thanks for the turbulence info. I'm curious because there are strange wave-like variations in some parameters, from this flight and the last, that look as if they might be the autopilot searching a little and putting waves into the data.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:31:43] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Charlie - Nice, I wish I could get some output on javascript console.  I suppose it didn't say what file?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:31:57] <JorgenJensen-GV> Right now we arw bouncing again
[GMT 12/03/05 05:32:10] <AlCooper-home> ChrisWebster-mobil I now see a good flight track on my Google map, after reloading again. Nice!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:32:55] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> It happens every ten seconds, so it must be in the code that is doing the updates.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:35:58] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Ok I'm finally getting a track too.  Maybe it had get registered interanlly at google.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:36:05] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Debby says that we need a "cute icon" for the plane, rather than a dull red dot.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:36:23] <ChrisWebster-mobil> AlCooper-home now click on the mag-glass to the right of 'Flight 2'
[GMT 12/03/05 05:37:14] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I had to do a refresh on the page, then the mag glass worked.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:37:56] <ChrisWebster-mobil> I motice the GPS is still working, we actually took off on the runway not in the dirt.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:38:42] <AlCooper-home> ChrisWebster-mobil That works and looks good. 
[GMT 12/03/05 05:39:42] <ChrisWebster-mobil> Al, so you can see an altitude or temperature plot?
[GMT 12/03/05 05:40:28] <ChrisWebster-mobil> There over that little lake on C470 where you can drop in waterski.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:40:49] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> or wind surf
[GMT 12/03/05 05:41:09] <AlCooper-home> ChrisWebster-mobil Yes, I can see either of those plots and a list of others.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:41:31] <ChrisWebster-mobil> good.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:46:08] <ChrisWebster-mobil> GordonMaclean-GV so I've been copying the files to my laptop once they pull up to the ramp, then download them later.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:47:29] <ChrisWebster-mobil> That way they don't have to put power on in the hanger....that assumes you have an ethernet cable...
[GMT 12/03/05 05:47:53] <GordonMaclean-GV> I can do that, or just runn off the UPS
[GMT 12/03/05 05:48:02] <Cowan-Home> Goodnight. Looks like a good flight. See you at 1000 but I'll be in at 0800.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:48:10] Cowan-Home (jcowan@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: I've Had Tooo Much Fun!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:48:18] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> Chris - grab the jpg files from linus:/tmp. They are really nice.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:48:43] <ChrisWebster-mobil> I think we should have 1 second update near landing!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:49:46] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> welcome home.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:50:14] AVAPS (AVAPS@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Read error: Connection reset by peer
[GMT 12/03/05 05:50:26] <JorgenJensen-GV> Gracias muchos!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:50:36] <ChrisWebster-mobil> I thnk they are going to crash into the C130 , I see it on the ramp in the GoogleMap!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:50:58] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> they are in the grass now.
[GMT 12/03/05 05:52:10] <ChrisWebster-mobil> And they skirted the C130, nice work!
[GMT 12/03/05 05:53:39] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> so, grab those jpegs...
[GMT 12/03/05 05:53:59] <ChrisWebster-mobil> got em, downloading a tool to look at em.  new laptop...
[GMT 12/03/05 05:54:32] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> firefox does the job nicely...
