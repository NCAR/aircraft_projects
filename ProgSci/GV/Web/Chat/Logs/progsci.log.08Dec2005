[GMT 12/08/05 17:43:46] <SteveOncley-GV> Hi Brian -- could you test sending the latest satellite images to us?   We are using pac-northwest visible.  Thanks.
[GMT 12/08/05 17:54:43] <SteveOncley-GV> BrianMedeiros-ucla Are you looking at chat in &progsci?
[GMT 12/08/05 18:01:40] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> I'll send the satellite image in just a second. I'll repost our summary here now.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:01:55] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> From our view, the best POC area is in a N-S extended region further west. It has a "head" centered around 127W, 37N. 
[GMT 12/08/05 18:02:01] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> It looks like cirrus covers the southern extent of the feature though, so I'd recommend heading toward 128W,38N.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:02:07] <SteveOncley-GV> okay -- I'll watch for the images.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:02:07] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Between that "head" a large clear region (N-S along 125W-129W, 40N-45N), there appears to be a stripe of stratocumulus. 
[GMT 12/08/05 18:02:07] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Bjorn recommends heading to the POC first, then to the stratocumulus.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:04:55] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Okay, I think the file should be on its way. Let me know if you never get it.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:05:42] <SteveOncley-GV> If I understand the process, it should arrive shortly after 11:10 here (even 5-minute boundary), so very soon.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:08:13] <SteveOncley-GV> Nothing yet, we may have to wait to 11:15...
[GMT 12/08/05 18:10:51] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> In the meantime, I'm going to also try to send the 1730 image too, just the region of interest.

[GMT 12/08/05 19:14:01] <AlCooper-GV> We (Steve Oncley and I) were apparently not receiving chat for a few minutes. Maybe related, I downloaded the image directly from the web site because we needed it for flight planning, so we have that now (the 1730 image). If there were messages to us in the last 10 min or so, we probably missed them
[GMT 12/08/05 19:16:45] <GordonMaclean-FL> The satcom network connection dropped and has been re-established
[GMT 12/08/05 19:19:14] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> The 1800 image is available, should I try to ftp it to you?
[GMT 12/08/05 19:23:12] <AlCooper-GV> Yes, we'd welcome an update (in case we get the upload from the ground to work). I'm reluctant to upload another image outside the planned link unless it looks like we need it. Do you see significant change that would affect our planning? (We have adjusted the target point to 129W 40N on the basis of the image we got.)

[GMT 12/08/05 19:25:20] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> There's nothing too surprising in the 1800 image. 129W, 40N seems like a good target for now. It might be optimal to go a little south of 40N once you get closer.

[GMT 12/08/05 19:28:27] <SteveOncley-GV> Yeah, we are aware of the option to go south once we get to 40N129W.
[GMT 12/08/05 19:31:11] <AlCooper-GV> Now flying over the coast. All looks well for now.
[GMT 12/08/05 19:31:17] <AlCooper-GV> A couple of data notes follow:
[GMT 12/08/05 19:31:39] <AlCooper-GV> (1) temperatures are all in reasonable agreement, and all about 5C colder than AT_A
[GMT 12/08/05 19:32:22] <AlCooper-GV> (2) dewpoints still show the 10s cycle to negative-max in the plots and ASCII listings, but curiously not in stats for aeros which displays a reasonable mean and variance
[GMT 12/08/05 19:32:56] <AlCooper-GV> (3) DPs have shown surprising ability to track changes even at very low humidity, and the changes appear real in comparison to TDL counts
[GMT 12/08/05 19:34:09] <AlCooper-GV> (4) Chris changed the PALT calculation before the flight, and pressure altitude is now in agreement with the cockpit
[GMT 12/08/05 19:36:31] <AlCooper-GV> making a strong contrail, by the way. Visible in ground shadow. Nice glories visible in lower clouds also.
[GMT 12/08/05 19:37:32] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> That reminds me... Bjorn says to take good notes and lots of photos.

[GMT 12/08/05 21:09:34] <AlCooper-GV> -117.55, 40.35 lat-l;ong at present, at the northern extent of the circle
[GMT 12/08/05 21:10:34] <laptop1-g5> (from DaveR on GV) CONCN came alive ~21:04 when I turned on its pump. It has had some flow through it, but apparently will not send conc data unless pump is on. 
[GMT 12/08/05 21:11:40] <laptop1-g5> (from DaveR-GV) CONCN ~200-300/cc is reasonable value. Flow is still less than target, but CN appears to be making useful data.

[GMT 12/08/05 21:15:41] <AlCooper-GV> No, we didn't see it yet. I'll watch for it.

[GMT 12/08/05 21:20:06] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> The extended POC we were watching seems to have moved south and west. There is a N-S region of open cells right along 130W, from about 41N going to south of 37N. A good cloud boundary is to your west as well, before the POC, at maybe 129.5W.
[GMT 12/08/05 21:21:41] <AlCooper-GV> Brian, thanks, we now have the 2000 image here. Steve and Don are coordinating this circle, so haven't had time to look at it yet.

[GMT 12/08/05 21:29:12] <SteveOncley-GV> We are now at 39.7N, 127.6W, which looks to me like the best place in the 20Z image you sent up.  Just finishing circle #1,
[GMT 12/08/05 21:30:42] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Do you think you got through the POC earlier... from our vantage point it looks like you might have been a little north and east of it. And do you need anything from us?
[GMT 12/08/05 21:33:39] <SteveOncley-GV> I think we're pretty well committed at this point.  This patch seems pretty uniform -- probably not as much cloud as you'd like, but I don't think going a bit south would have changed things significantly.  Don't know how much more you can do for us.  Thanks!
[GMT 12/08/05 21:35:01] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Okay, I'll send the 2100 satellite image when it is available, so you can check things out. How much more time do you have?

[GMT 12/08/05 21:55:27] <SteveOncley-GV> We're always flying 30min circles.  With an airspeed of about 220knots, it should be about 0.5degree in diameter.

[GMT 12/08/05 22:03:10] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Hi Steve, Al & Don, this is Bjorn at Brian's terminal.  I've been looking over his shoulder, and we are concerned that you might have missed the heart of the elongated region of open cells.  In my mind trying to make sure you get there would be a priority.  Any thoughts on going west?
[GMT 12/08/05 22:08:44] <SteveOncley-GV> Are you proposing going out to 130W38N?  If so, I think it is too far.  We only have another 1.5 hours to fly.  If you are suggesting something shorter, we're all ears.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:09:25] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> well if you don't sample the poc at least a little bit I fail to see the point of the rest
[GMT 12/08/05 22:10:35] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> so the answer is yes.. i would skip the circles and just go out there and get as much pbl data as you can in that region before going home.  looking at things closer we were confused as it seems that all your time even near the POC was spent at altitude, i.e., not descending until about 2100.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:11:44] <SteveOncley-GV> The delay was getting air traffic control permission to descend (and dropsonde diagnosing).
[GMT 12/08/05 22:12:12] <SteveOncley-GV> Are you proposing 130/38?  Don is here looking over my shoulder.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:12:15] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> btw, ferrying there in the pbl is less efficient, but in my mind the best strategy, i.e., ferry to 130W 38N in the PBL then do a short sounding there to get above the pbl, then descend back in the PBL and ferry east until you get back to the boring things.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:12:24] <JohnWasinger-GV> (DaveR) - we are shutting off DU equipment -- too hot. Will restart later after it cools down.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:12:32] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> yes 130/38
[GMT 12/08/05 22:14:27] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> how long will it take you to get there?
[GMT 12/08/05 22:15:41] <SteveOncley-GV> The pilots are working on this calculation now.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:16:07] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> good.. there is a chance that something will hang together at 130W, but you definitely need to be father west
[GMT 12/08/05 22:16:29] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> sorry, i meant to say there is a chance that something will hang together as far north as 40N
[GMT 12/08/05 22:18:38] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> looking at the 2200 image (i.e., current 20 minutes ago it seems that you might need to go to 131, but could stay at 40N if that is better
[GMT 12/08/05 22:20:27] <JohnWasinger-GV> Can someone call Chuck or Shanu and ask them for some guideance on the operation of the pumps.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:20:34] <SteveOncley-GV> We're currently headed to 130/38.  There is a limit to how much I want to change things on the pilots.  Would 130/38 work?

[GMT 12/08/05 22:23:51] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Actually vectoring to 131 W at your current latitutde is a better choice.  I would let the pilots tell you if that is not a good idea.  We are uploading a much better image, it should show up soon.

[GMT 12/08/05 22:25:18] <AlCooper-GV> Hi Dick, you will be interested that the temperatures here are in quite good agreement, esp. the R sensors, and all are in agreement with AT_A. We're at low level, so T is between 0 and 10C. Earlier, at altitude, with T<-50, there was a 5C difference, with AT_A higher but all others in agreement at the lower value.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:27:24] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Bjorn again... the figure is on its way.  The feature that needs to be sampled is the northsouth elongated area of open cells just west of 130.  I would give up on circles and simply cut across it in a line... if you can get there by going south, fine... let us know if you get the image and are clear on what we are thinking (I have a gaggle of undergrads waiting for me and will have to jump away soon).
[GMT 12/08/05 22:29:34] <Jcowan-Jeffco> All, please check channel &G5 for resolution on DU Rack.  Chuck is there waiting for a response.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:31:08] <SteveOncley-GV> We're asking the pilots...haven't received the 22Z image yet.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:31:10] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Hey, if the pilots want to hang out longer, I will buy dinner if they land in Santa Monica (saves fuel)
[GMT 12/08/05 22:31:29] <dickfriesen-jeffco> Alcooper- Thanks for temp update. Agreement is good. Difference from AT_A maybe mach or altitude realated or both. 
[GMT 12/08/05 22:31:55] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> ps that was still Bjorn, I will tell you when I am Brian again.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:33:11] <SteveOncley-GV> Bjorn's offer has been forwarded to the cockpit.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:34:11] Nick change: Ta-GV -> kurt_ads
[GMT 12/08/05 22:35:23] <kurt_ads> The DU rack has been shut down, all the red lights are off.

[GMT 12/08/05 22:38:19] <BjornStevens-UCLA> Okay, I finally changed my name, as I can be here another 10 minutes before I have to run off and teach.  
[GMT 12/08/05 22:40:11] <SteveOncley-GV> Alright, Bjorn -- 131/40 it is -- we're on our way.  Pilots estimate 1 hour on station, which is 1 circle plus some profiling.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:40:23] <SteveOncley-GV> Estimated ETA 17min.

[GMT 12/08/05 22:41:02] <SteveOncley-GV> Clouds are definitely thicker here at 39.6/130.0.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:41:38] <SteveOncley-GV> Still haven't received the 22Z photo :(
[GMT 12/08/05 22:42:55] <BjornStevens-UCLA> okay, that sounds great... looking at ION you are on a good track.    I wouldn't spend too much time on profiling, i.e., you could just due an exit sounding.  As for levels, since we have no cloud probes, I would try to be near the surface as there we will get the best signatures of drizzle cold pools if any exist.  Also consider flying along the pocs axis which is north south at 40N, extending to about 41N
[GMT 12/08/05 22:43:20] <SteveOncley-GV> We just hit a clear pocket at 39.7/130.2.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:43:23] <BjornStevens-UCLA> We just got the 2230 image.. the main axis of the poc is now at 130.3W, you.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:43:38] <BjornStevens-UCLA> That clear pocket is the start of the poc... you are more or less there... we will forward another image
[GMT 12/08/05 22:45:19] <BjornStevens-UCLA> we just uploaded the 2230 image, it is called progsci_fig.gif and should come up like the others did (or didnt)
[GMT 12/08/05 22:45:20] <SteveOncley-GV> We're passing drizzle patches.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:45:30] <BjornStevens-UCLA> hurrah!... didn't we say so?!
[GMT 12/08/05 22:45:46] <SteveOncley-GV> ...yes you did...
[GMT 12/08/05 22:46:05] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> SteveOncley-GV do you plan any more circles today?
[GMT 12/08/05 22:46:52] <SteveOncley-GV> We're probably in our last one, Chris.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:47:05] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I have a fix compiled up there.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:47:06] <SteveOncley-GV> ...maybe one more...
[GMT 12/08/05 22:47:09] StuartBeaton-jeffco (beaton@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &progsci.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:47:12] <BjornStevens-UCLA> okay, I have to run.. somehow I have to prepare my lecture in the next 5 minutes.   But my final word would be to consider a couple of shallow soundings, i.e., just to get the measure of the PBL depth, but then fly up and down the POC axis (going no further N than 41N)... the feature is exactly NS... and beg the pilots for more time.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:47:42] <BjornStevens-UCLA> oh yeah, an ask them what they want for dinner... I know a good sushi place.

[GMT 12/08/05 22:56:02] <SteveOncley-GV> ChrisWebster : sorry, I've been busy doing the circle nav manually, also somehow couldn't accept your chat window.  Is the update straightforward?
[GMT 12/08/05 22:57:45] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> yes, but you need to do it, since I can't log into that computer for some reason.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:58:01] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> let me give directions over on the G5 channel.
[GMT 12/08/05 22:58:14] <SteveOncley-GV> fine...I'll look there...

[GMT 12/08/05 23:25:01] <SteveOncley-GV> We're just finishing up now, we got one circle in the POC (lots of clear sky+drizzle) at the surface, now doing the porpoises.  Then we'll leave.
[GMT 12/08/05 23:30:07] <dickfriesen-jeffco> Oncley - nice porpoises. Speed run?

[GMT 12/08/05 23:32:31] <laptop3-G5> (DaveR-GV) The RDMA pump quit, probably from overheating. We let it cool for about an hour and then tried restart, but it does not come on. Therefore, RDMA is down until pump is fixed/changed. We have a spare at Jeffco.
[GMT 12/08/05 23:33:08] <SteveOncley-GV> Dick: these porpoises are boundary-layer sampling.  Al Schanot had suggested speed runs at altitude during the ferry.  Are you suggesting something else?

[GMT 12/08/05 23:35:38] <dickfriesen-jeffco> oncley- Didn't know that Al requested runs. that's good. I was suggesting a sinusoidal variation takes a couple of minutes if you have time.

[GMT 12/08/05 23:38:04] <schanot_jeffco> Can I assume that you are penetrating the stratus deck on profiling?  Clearly we still have an issue with the absolute values of our temps and dewpoints.
[GMT 12/08/05 23:39:19] <SteveOncley-G5> Affirmative.  In-and-out of clouds.
[GMT 12/08/05 23:40:18] <SteveOncley-G5> I believe we've been doing 2000'/min.  Is that too fast for the thermodynamic sensors?
[GMT 12/08/05 23:42:05] <JohnWasinger-GV> DU Rack is back up...

[GMT 12/08/05 23:49:36] <BjornStevens-UCLA> Hi All, it looks like you have been having fun while I was teaching.  FYI, I brought the class (a small freshman seminar) to Brian's office, to show them why my lecture was so poorly prepared... they seemed to enjoy it.  As we walked out one of the students (a physics major) said, "that is so cool, I am definitely going to graduate school"
