[GMT 12/21/05 15:03:59] <DaveR-Jeffco> laptop1- thanks for update. I am watching WCN values from here. It seems to be making reasonable values now.

[GMT 12/21/05 18:27:33] <teresa-gv> dave r: I've been trying for the past hour or maybe longer to wet the wcn, but keep getting the 'out of water' indications (flashing liquid indicator, out of water message on display).
[GMT 12/21/05 18:27:42] <teresa-gv> dave: would you like me to keep priming, or is there a risk of flooding?
[GMT 12/21/05 18:34:25] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- no, I think you can cease trying to get it to drink. The issue may be an air bubble within tubing inside the instrument.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:35:05] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- the manufacturer would like us to fly it with the cover removed, or perhaps with a window installed so we can see what's happening.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:36:05] <teresa-gv> dave: thanks.  Sounds like a good idea if that mod will be okayed by our cert staff :-)
[GMT 12/21/05 18:47:34] <teresa-gv> we are finally close enough to see the nice wave clouds.  They are pretty high and in the area where traffic is likely to be an issue.  The pilots think it would be difficult to spring this on atc at this location at the last minute
[GMT 12/21/05 18:48:45] <teresa-gv> If we want to sample them, we would need to setup a flgiht where we can work out a location to work where the clouds are likely that gives us better access to airspace and a plan filed with atc ahead of time
[GMT 12/21/05 18:49:45] <teresa-gv> It would not be out of the question to try a second flight today, but I suspect it would compete with fixing things and it would likley bump against some crew duty issues because of that
[GMT 12/21/05 18:50:34] <teresa-gv> I see teresa has changed this chat to her, this was jeff
