[GMT 12/13/05 21:08:14] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Jeff: nice cloud passes, useful for T also (if we believe DPs, which are reaching steady values in cloud). So far, Ts look reasonable (except for being offset all over from AT_A).
[GMT 12/13/05 21:08:47] <AlCooper-Jeffco> BTW, I just got the sonde data from RF04 so should be able to use that for some evidence re sensor performance.
[GMT 12/13/05 21:10:53] <ron> concn and the left dewpoint are spiky
[GMT 12/13/05 21:11:05] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Serious probe wetting and evaporative cooling of these thermometers in cloud, I think. [cf just before 2110]

[GMT 12/13/05 21:16:01] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Unfortunately, your pretty far from any NEXRADs here so I can't give you good info on reflectivities. The clouds over the mountains west of Las Vegas NM are the nearest echoes I see on the ABQ NEXRAD, and reflectivities there don't exceed 20 dBz, but they look a little south of where you are.
[GMT 12/13/05 21:16:05] <shanhu> AlCooper,  i want to talk to Chuck Wilson,,, Please call him for me.  Can you?
[GMT 12/13/05 21:16:24] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Shanhu: do you have a phone number handy?
[GMT 12/13/05 21:18:29] <shanhu> Al,, thanks his Phone is 303 871 3002, cell 720 219 3903....  Ask him we are at 2- 3 km, is it OK to use instruments??
[GMT 12/13/05 21:22:17] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Shanhu: sorry, no answer at either number. I'll try again soon.
[GMT 12/13/05 21:31:42] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Shanhu: I see you're at 20,000 ft now, so I presume it's OK to turn on your instruments and you don't need me to keep trying Chuck's phones? Please let me know if I can stop trying.

[GMT 12/13/05 21:54:06] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Further info for Jeff and for the record, for interpretation of the onboard radar  (I understand he's not monitoring chat, but might like to know this): There's some echo in the vicinity you've been flying, but only at about 10 dBz on the ABQ radar. There's some 35 dBz out west from you, near Los Alamos.
