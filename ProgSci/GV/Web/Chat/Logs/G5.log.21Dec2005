[GMT 12/21/05 15:07:24] <LauraPan-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, at the end point where we expect to do some deep sounding, forecast show precip low level clouds. Please watch for us if that ever got to become a potential problem

[GMT 12/21/05 15:28:13] <schanot_jeffco> Thanks
[GMT 12/21/05 15:29:39] <DaveR-Jeffco> Bill- can you pls check that rake is making data? 
[GMT 12/21/05 15:33:29] <BillIrwin-GV> PSRake showed a climb from 829 to 833 from take off
[GMT 12/21/05 15:35:38] <DaveR-Jeffco> Bill- looks like PSRAKE and QCRAKE are stuck at values before take-off. These come from CHAPS rack, Mensor and Paroscientific sensors.l
[GMT 12/21/05 15:36:47] <BillIrwin-GV> QCRake is stuck after reaching altitude of 40k, what can I do
[GMT 12/21/05 15:37:58] <BillIrwin-GV> QCRake stuck at -44mb, but showed life before reaching altitude
[GMT 12/21/05 15:40:31] <DaveR-Jeffco> Bill- pondering the issue; stand by.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:43:57] <schanot_jeffco> Is it possible that there is a leak to the cabin.  Cabin pressure is very close the the value displayed for PSRAKE
[GMT 12/21/05 15:44:29] <DaveR-Jeffco> Looks like affected sensors are on CHAPS rack. Some are okay (PDUMPL, PDUMPR). Others look bad (PSRAKE, QCRAKE). PCAB has hardly changed since take-off. I would have thought the cabin pressure drops somewhat -- you might ask pilots what they are showing for cabin.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:44:37] <BillIrwin-GV> Also, TTHL1 at 15:20Z left us and is recording at 15plus degrees warmer than the other 3
[GMT 12/21/05 15:45:02] <DaveR-Jeffco> Pressure measurements from the nose DSM look okay.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:47:24] <jeff> for john w or chris.   the track plot on aeros does not work.  Only displays one point.  Any suggestions?
[GMT 12/21/05 15:48:29] <BillIrwin-GV> PCAB may be working fine, don't watch that much, but once we reached 7000 cabin was pressurized and is holding steady from that point on
[GMT 12/21/05 15:48:54] <BillIrwin-GV> Track didn't work well yesterday also
[GMT 12/21/05 15:48:55] <DaveR-Jeffco> Bill- suggest checking that pressure tray on CHAPS rack has power.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:49:08] <BillIrwin-GV> Watch Dean's Steet and Smiths Map, more better!
[GMT 12/21/05 15:52:10] <schanot_jeffco> I know how to fix the track

[GMT 12/21/05 15:52:56] <schanot_jeffco> when it comes up it should display a variable list.  it is missing a value for heading.  if you click on THDG and then hit apply it works correctly
[GMT 12/21/05 15:53:31] <DaveR-Jeffco> Bill- other possibilities: (1) during last night's swap of rake and M-HIMIL, maybe the two rake hoses were damaged; (2) DSM (306?) is not getting serial feed from press sensors.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:54:28] <jeff> power seems to be on
[GMT 12/21/05 15:54:49] <schanot_jeffco> Bill - don't worry about TTHL1, it has moved around for each flt.  Other values are stable from flts rf06 to today.  getting good results on those outputs.

[GMT 12/21/05 15:56:11] <BillIrwin-GV> ok, we are getting power on rake rack, serial lines look good and don't think were touched last night, as best I can see from here tubing to Rake looks ok
[GMT 12/21/05 15:56:13] <DaveR-Jeffco> Bill- note that this morning, I found big leak in 1/8" pressure scanner tubing that leads from nitrogen bottle to scanner. It is supposed to carry 100 psi, only used for changing internal valve positions. Since we don't ever change valve positions, that leak is not a show-stopper, and should not affect data.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:57:42] <BillIrwin-GV> I see big change in QCRake after take off and see PSRake change some from take off...so don't think it's a dsm issue
[GMT 12/21/05 15:58:21] <jeff> nitrogen bottle seems to be off
[GMT 12/21/05 15:58:29] <LauraPan-GV> AlCooper-Jeffco, need urgent help contact Rushan for ozone  inst anomaly
[GMT 12/21/05 15:58:43] <LauraPan-GV> schanot_jeffco, I meant to write to you for that
[GMT 12/21/05 15:58:58] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Talking with Al and Dave now.
[GMT 12/21/05 15:59:22] <LauraPan-GV> but either you or Al C could help will be great
[GMT 12/21/05 16:00:07] <LauraPan-GV> AlCooper-Jeffco, schanot_jeffco , need help from either of you to call Rushan Gao 497-5431
[GMT 12/21/05 16:00:31] <LauraPan-GV> Ozone instrument has been off

[GMT 12/21/05 16:02:29] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill, do you have lights on the RAKE scanner? Have you checked the RAKE data to see if it is okay?
[GMT 12/21/05 16:02:31] <LauraPan-GV> please let me know if you got this msg on the ground
[GMT 12/21/05 16:03:07] <Jcowan-Jeffco> LauraPan-GV, Al S is calling now.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:03:54] <jeff> we have lights on rake, will check
[GMT 12/21/05 16:04:27] <BillIrwin-GV> Power, Transmit, and link are on
[GMT 12/21/05 16:04:31] <jeff> lights on rake on are pwr, lnk, tx
[GMT 12/21/05 16:05:05] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill, lets go to &techs please.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:05:35] <BillIrwin-GV> Did any tubing get kinked last night?
[GMT 12/21/05 16:06:05] <LauraPan-GV> Jcowan-Jeffco, Thanks, which Al?
[GMT 12/21/05 16:06:25] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Laura, Rushan asks status of the two lights when you recycle, and he suggests leaving on the larger switch but switching off the small switch. That should turn out the green light, but the red light should stay on. Wait 2 min, then turn on again. You should get a green light temporarily, which will then go off for a minute or so, then should come back on.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:06:50] <LauraPan-GV> Got it S
[GMT 12/21/05 16:06:59] <DaveR-Jeffco> Jeff- I left nitrogen bottle valve OFF this morning, after finding leak. 
[GMT 12/21/05 16:08:13] <jeff> ok, do you want it to stay that way?
[GMT 12/21/05 16:08:15] <LauraPan-GV> during our last try, this was what happenned - the green instrument light was already off. We switched the power l(red light) off and waited for a minute before restarting the instrument again following the procedure
[GMT 12/21/05 16:10:15] <LauraPan-GV> the red light (power) is on and followed by inst (green light) on off as prescribed. The green light inside the box came on as expected
[GMT 12/21/05 16:10:26] <AlCooper-Jeffco> OK, please try leaving the power switch on (red light on), turn other switch off (green light off), wait 2 min, then turn on again and report what happens. [any change in green light?]
[GMT 12/21/05 16:10:58] <LauraPan-GV> it stayed on for ~ half minute and went off. the green (instr) light on the box never came back on
[GMT 12/21/05 16:12:15] <AlCooper-Jeffco> OK, I'll report that to Rushan and see what he thinks. Please leave a while longer and see if the green light comes on, while I call him back.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:12:42] <LauraPan-GV> I will now try to follow your insruction
[GMT 12/21/05 16:13:16] <LauraPan-GV> What you read was last try
[GMT 12/21/05 16:13:16] <jeff> ok power on again, small switch off
[GMT 12/21/05 16:13:28] <LauraPan-GV> we are trying now again following your instruction of 2 min wait after the red light
[GMT 12/21/05 16:13:52] <LauraPan-GV> Jeff is at the station reporting to you 
[GMT 12/21/05 16:15:33] <jeff> small switch on green light on
[GMT 12/21/05 16:15:42] <jeff> green light off
[GMT 12/21/05 16:15:51] <jeff> waiting for green light to return
[GMT 12/21/05 16:16:22] <jeff> green light back on, cheers in the cabin
[GMT 12/21/05 16:16:27] <jeff> green light off again, boo
[GMT 12/21/05 16:16:31] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Great!
[GMT 12/21/05 16:16:38] <AlCooper-Jeffco> (oops)
[GMT 12/21/05 16:17:01] <LauraPan-GV> AlCooper-Jeffco, the instrument came on but went down again
[GMT 12/21/05 16:17:57] <LauraPan-GV> The inside light is still on
[GMT 12/21/05 16:18:10] <LauraPan-GV> the green light on the box went down
[GMT 12/21/05 16:18:18] <jeff> the power light is on the green light is off still
[GMT 12/21/05 16:18:28] <AlCooper-Jeffco> OK, Rushan says that's "bad news" and the only thing he can suggest is to reseat the PCMCIA card. I'll tell you how to do this, but this is something that needs awareness of the onboard tech and his assistance. Please get him while I type instructions. He will need to notify cockpit. (It's a fairly minor procedure, so I think it will be OK, but it will require opening the door on the side of the instrument.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:18:54] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Here's the procedure:
[GMT 12/21/05 16:19:03] <AlCooper-Jeffco> 1. both power switches off.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:19:32] <AlCooper-Jeffco> 2. On right side of instrument, see a small door closed by two fasteners. Turn them and open using the small tab.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:19:51] <AlCooper-Jeffco> 3. Inside, see PCMCIA card
[GMT 12/21/05 16:20:18] <AlCooper-Jeffco> 4. Remove it and reseat it. (He hopes that the problem is that computer is not getting data from the card.)
[GMT 12/21/05 16:20:27] <AlCooper-Jeffco> 5. Replace door
[GMT 12/21/05 16:20:38] <AlCooper-Jeffco> 6. Repeat start-up procedure.

[GMT 12/21/05 16:30:35] <jeff> a waste
[GMT 12/21/05 16:30:48] <AlCooper-Jeffco> I'll tell Rushan just in case he has thought of anything else.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:31:23] <schanot_jeffco> How long to a point where the pilots will make a drop?
[GMT 12/21/05 16:31:52] <LauraPan-GV> Let's think about this - if CO and water vapor are working well, there might still be value to fly 
[GMT 12/21/05 16:32:07] <LauraPan-GV> We are mid way to our planned end point
[GMT 12/21/05 16:32:34] <schanot_jeffco> it is still important to get a dropsonde tesat also
[GMT 12/21/05 16:33:06] <schanot_jeffco> check with pilots on locations for a drop.
[GMT 12/21/05 16:33:21] <LauraPan-GV> The alternative is to return and hope the instrument get fixed for tomorrow's flight
[GMT 12/21/05 16:33:57] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Rushan still says there's nothing to be done, and it's definitely not working. He wants to remove the instrument upon return and see if he can get it fixed.

[GMT 12/21/05 17:17:39] <LauraPan-GV> Bill R are you there?
[GMT 12/21/05 17:20:41] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: yes.  Where are you flying to today?
[GMT 12/21/05 17:21:04] <jeff> track program on aeros still inop
[GMT 12/21/05 17:22:22] <KenBowman-G5> BillRandel-ML, Hi Bill.  Laura is in the back of the aircraft.  We flew NE to Lake Superior, but are aborting the mission due to problems with the ozone instrument.
[GMT 12/21/05 17:23:42] <BillIrwin-GV> test
[GMT 12/21/05 17:25:00] <jeff> we have been flying over a low-level sc deck for much of hte northern portion of the flight.   Just going over a "hole" now.   Who needs the ocean?
[GMT 12/21/05 17:25:12] <jeff> Starting speed runs for teresa
[GMT 12/21/05 17:25:40] <ErrolFL1> Dean - I will come out and meet the plane and perhaps you can fill me in on current sonde launch technique then
[GMT 12/21/05 17:31:37] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel-ML, if you are there and got the msg, could you call Mel (8965) to let him know?
[GMT 12/21/05 17:33:19] <LauraPan-GV> We hope the instrument get fixed and have a flight tomorrow
[GMT 12/21/05 17:33:24] <jeff> note slight change in agreement among airspeed variables as speed slows--better agreement at slower speeds
[GMT 12/21/05 17:34:05] <jeff> starting second speed run
[GMT 12/21/05 17:38:27] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV, I called Mel and left a message (he didn't answer)
[GMT 12/21/05 17:39:48] <LauraPan-GV> could you also call chris davis (8990) and see if the stratCu look promissing tomorrow?
[GMT 12/21/05 17:40:33] <LauraPan-GV> if not, we should look for a combined START and maybe 1 hr mt wv flight
[GMT 12/21/05 17:42:59] <jeff> tasr is the variable that is most in disagreement with the other airspeed measurements.  Appears about 2 m/s high at higher airspeeds, other variables track pretty well
[GMT 12/21/05 17:43:10] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: I called Chris.  He hasn't looked yet, but will get back to me soon (and I'll forward it to you)
[GMT 12/21/05 17:45:47] <LauraPan-GV> Thanks. we will all be on ground soon enough for the planning meeting 1pm
[GMT 12/21/05 17:46:19] <LauraPan-GV> schanot_jeffco,  Bob thought the ETA would be 12:10-12:15
[GMT 12/21/05 17:47:20] <DeanL-GV> All three drops today look excellent.  Sonde GPS of the last data point shows that they all splashed in Lake Superiror in a line 50-70 miles NW of the town of Superior and about 10-15 miles from the MN shore.
[GMT 12/21/05 17:47:24] <LauraPan-GV> I am asking for a sawtooth before landing to get a tropopause crossing. In process with ATC
[GMT 12/21/05 17:50:01] dickfriesen-jeffco (rbf@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/21/05 17:50:28] <jeff> note changes in static pressure at 1742 during speed run
[GMT 12/21/05 17:54:37] <SteveR-FL1> DeanL - and how far outside of controlled airspace was that, exactly?
[GMT 12/21/05 17:56:11] <pavel-jeffco> It was safe.
[GMT 12/21/05 17:56:45] <schanot_jeffco> jeff- the primary place we still have pcor questions is up haigh like you are and at the higher speed.
[GMT 12/21/05 17:58:46] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Laura, I have told Rushan that you are returning early, and he plans to be at Jeffco by about 1230.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:00:01] <LauraPan-GV> Thank you Al
[GMT 12/21/05 18:00:43] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: I talked to Mel.  He wonders if you can arrange to fly around the lee-wave clouds south of Boulder on your way home
[GMT 12/21/05 18:02:11] <LauraPan-GV> We need to know the specific really soon
[GMT 12/21/05 18:02:50] <LauraPan-GV> we have cleared with ATC to do a up profile to 43-45 then drop to 36 to go home
[GMT 12/21/05 18:03:07] <LauraPan-GV> not sure if a good plan can be made in flight
[GMT 12/21/05 18:04:54] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: Let me know if there's anything I can do.  Mel suggests flying through and above the lee wave clouds if possible
[GMT 12/21/05 18:05:18] <jeff> do you  have a location for the wave clouds?
[GMT 12/21/05 18:05:51] <DeanL-GV> SteveR-FL1 - no way for me to know that.  Maybe not at all???  Our heading during the drops was about 45 deg and our path over the lake bisected the westmost arm of Lake Superior.  We made a left 180 turn a few minutes after the last drop that took us briefly into Canada.  BTW, our drop altitude was FL410. 
[GMT 12/21/05 18:08:26] <jeff> bill and or mel, we could only do wave clouds if they are not in the area of departures/arrivals for denver
[GMT 12/21/05 18:08:32] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel-ML, we don't have much time left for requesting change. the location will need to be really easy otherwise we are heading back
[GMT 12/21/05 18:08:54] <SteveR-FL1> DeanL-just kidding. If you're inside the US boundary and at or above FL180, it's controlled airspace.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:09:58] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: Mel says right over Boulder (Bouolder canyon).  I can't see from my window, but am going to have a look.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:10:06] <DeanL-GV> SteveR-  okay, I thought you  meant US vs Canada airspace.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:10:40] <SteveR-FL1> DeanL - any difference in the binding on the plastic door?
[GMT 12/21/05 18:12:48] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: I went to look, and there's a nice big lee wave cloud just west of the Mesa Lab. (also some nice lenticular waves north of Boulder, but that's an aside)
[GMT 12/21/05 18:12:52] <DeanL-GV> SteveR-FL1 -- no, about the same as yesterday when it was at its coldest, stiff but still easily lifted.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:14:15] <jeff> any idea on the altitudes of the wave cloud?
[GMT 12/21/05 18:16:09] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel-ML, the pilots are asking for an altitude, Jeff has given an estimate of 18K. 
[GMT 12/21/05 18:16:49] <SteveR-FL1> DeanL - I was thinking I'd send a report to AeroMet about the arm safety pin, maybe I'll mention the binding.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:18:36] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: That altitude sounds reasonable.  Could you possibly make a couple of passes through and above the cloud?  Mel says they can run high resolution simulations for this case.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:19:42] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV: if the lee wave pass works out, let me know the approximate time.  I'd like to get some pictures.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:21:30] <LauraPan-GV> At moment, I think the pilots have decided to head home Jeffco. Jeff is up talking to them. I will let you know if there is a change
[GMT 12/21/05 18:22:07] <LauraPan-GV> It is a lot of arrangement with ATC to make change in short notice
[GMT 12/21/05 18:22:12] ErrolFL1 (Errol@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 12/21/05 18:22:14] <LauraPan-GV> I will keep you posted
[GMT 12/21/05 18:25:13] <DeanL-GV> SteveR-FL1 -- I just examined it again carefully and it's still quite stiff and sticks abit more at about 45 deg open.  However, all bolts, fittings, etc are loose enough in their mounting hole to be moved easily by fingers (ie. the AN bolts on the lid can be rotated by hand; not binding with anything visible/accessable.)
[GMT 12/21/05 18:26:26] Nick change: jeff -> teresa-gv
[GMT 12/21/05 18:28:36] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel-ML, Jeff is working with the pilots to see if there is a possible plan. Stay tunned.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:32:22] <teresa-gv> dave r: I've written a WCN update and question to the progsci chatroom.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:32:24] <SteveR-FL1> DeanL - don't s'poze you'd also mind stepping outside real quick to check the aircraft exterior?
[GMT 12/21/05 18:35:53] <DeanL-GV> SteveR -- perhaps a little later...
[GMT 12/21/05 18:37:38] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel-ML, we are asking for clearance. Will make a few pass if gettin git. Otherwise head to Jeffco
[GMT 12/21/05 18:38:00] <LauraPan-GV> Let Mel know that's the best we can do
[GMT 12/21/05 18:38:10] <LauraPan-GV> will update you any progress
[GMT 12/21/05 18:44:21] <LauraPan-GV> looks like we are going to Jeffco
[GMT 12/21/05 18:46:07] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel-ML, and all, we are heading to Jeffco
[GMT 12/21/05 18:46:51] <LauraPan-GV> the cloud is very high ~30K and we are already down. Too complicated to start a new flight plan. Landing soon.
[GMT 12/21/05 18:48:01] <BillRandel-ML> LauraPan-GV:  OK.  Talk to you later.
