[GMT 12/02/05 00:03:08] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Chris,  the TDL data rate can be changed once we have a maintenance day.  I tried to download new software yesterday evening, but it is involved (in a baroque, outof date way) and takes more than the two hours we had yesterday.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:05:06] <schanot_jeffco> Al.  We are using very preliminary pcors on both static and dynamic pressures.  Also, it is not clear that the G5 avionics is using the same calculation of pressure altitude that we are.  I do not find this difference suprizing.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:06:03] <LauraPan-GV> Hi Sue. are you online?
[GMT 12/02/05 00:06:16] <sueschauffler-ACD> Hi Laura, yes, I'm here
[GMT 12/02/05 00:08:20] <LauraPan-GV> Hope you have read the cmts I wrote for Brian earlier
[GMT 12/02/05 00:09:02] <LauraPan-GV> Ken, are you online too?
[GMT 12/02/05 00:09:04] <sueschauffler-ACD> No, I haven't seen them.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:10:43] <LauraPan-GV> let me repeat, we did really well recognizing the airmass and locate where we were w.r.t. the intrusion
[GMT 12/02/05 00:11:02] <KenBowman-TAMU> Hi Laura, yes, I'm online.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:11:03] <schanot_jeffco> Al.  On tf01 the two altitudes were similarly different up high, but the raw static pressures were virtually the same.  That clearly points to a coding difference.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:11:45] <sueschauffler-ACD> excellent! 
[GMT 12/02/05 00:11:55] <KenBowman-TAMU> Excellent news, Laura.  Did you get CO, O3, and H2O?
[GMT 12/02/05 00:12:29] <LauraPan-GV> Al and I are havng a good time cutting across intrusion based on as. RH, TDL counts and skew-T
[GMT 12/02/05 00:12:56] <LauraPan-GV> not as, I meant ws
[GMT 12/02/05 00:12:58] <sueschauffler-ACD> I'll see you at Jeffco. Brian may be there too. Bye
[GMT 12/02/05 00:13:41] <LauraPan-GV> we are flying home at 47kft right now
[GMT 12/02/05 00:14:46] <LauraPan-GV> I should actually say, at 380K level in the "overworld"

[GMT 12/02/05 00:15:18] <LauraPan-GV> I think we are getting these measurements - We don
[GMT 12/02/05 00:16:02] <KenBowman-TAMU> Laura, that is good news.  You should get a good profile on equatorward(?) side of the jet during descent.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:16:23] <LauraPan-GV> t have ozone , co data feed, TDL H2O data is not converted but the raw count looks good
[GMT 12/02/05 00:18:37] <LauraPan-GV> yes that is the plan - we had a slant cut from poleward of the intrusion 13kft for eq  wd 47kft
[GMT 12/02/05 00:19:10] <LauraPan-GV> we are desc now and heading to tropopause, light turbulence experienced
[GMT 12/02/05 00:19:32] <LauraPan-GV> Ken, the real time data is working. did you try to run aeros?
[GMT 12/02/05 00:20:01] <KenBowman-TAMU> I cannot access aeros from outside the firewall.  The web page feed is not working, so I have not seen any data.
[GMT 12/02/05 00:21:00] <LauraPan-GV> tomorrow I whope to show you the skewT in the least
[GMT 12/02/05 00:26:21] <LauraPan-GV> while we were chatting, the we corssed the tropopause at ~220 hPa
[GMT 12/02/05 00:27:36] <AlCooper-GV> allen: that appears to be the case now also. The raw pressures are close, and the small difference could not account for the altitude difference.

[GMT 12/02/05 22:51:03] <JorgenJensen-GV> Hi - Science question: Shanhu states that she thought the tropopause should be a theta of 380k, not the 326k we see now. Cooper/Stith/Chris Davis: Any comments? - We dont want to fly too far down, so can you advise?
[GMT 12/02/05 22:52:20] <JorgenJensen-GV> Can somebody phone Chris Davis and ask him?
[GMT 12/02/05 22:53:19] <JorgenJensen-GV> The sounding has shown no indication of a real turn towards stability, only occasional small excursions.

[GMT 12/02/05 22:56:42] <laptop4-g5> We begine to fly higher (40K ft) to check tropopause height.
[GMT 12/02/05 22:58:36] <DonLenschow_ops> I just called Chris Davis regarding the 380K vs 326K theta.  He will call me right back
[GMT 12/02/05 22:59:06] <laptop4-g5> thank you
[GMT 12/02/05 23:00:01] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Jorgen, while waiting for Chris: my reaction is 380K is way too high. 340K is more what I would have expected. 
[GMT 12/02/05 23:02:16] <JorgenJensen-GV> Yes, we just started climbing, and almost immediately ran into a very stable temp gradient. Our initial 36K was ideal altitude. We continue to 40kft, then I think we will request a return to 36kft.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:03:41] <schanot_jeffco> Looking at yesterday's flt.  THETA ranged from 367-337 duing one 40K ft constant altitude run and around 380 during the 47K ft run.

[GMT 12/02/05 23:05:02] <laptop4-g5> Schanot- was taht 40 K tropopause?
[GMT 12/02/05 23:06:18] <schanot_jeffco> Because of the tropopause folding yesterday I can't say.  Just passing on info.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:07:16] <DonLenschow_ops> at 200 mb (at 39,000 ft) at 18 N it is 345 K.  At San Diego at 200 mb it is 330 K.  you should see only excursions of between 330K to 345K going S from San Diego to 18N at 39,000 ft.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:09:43] <schanot_jeffco> I just plotted the sounding from the last descent yesterday - on hte south side of the jet..
[GMT 12/02/05 23:10:46] <schanot_jeffco> Tropopause at 38K ft with theta of 326-327.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:10:56] <laptop4-g5> ok
[GMT 12/02/05 23:12:12] <laptop4-g5> we are trying to down to 34k ft; if we see clouds there we will back up to 36K, otherwise we stay 34k until sandiego
[GMT 12/02/05 23:12:52] <schanot_jeffco> OK.  Good luck.  I'll be signing off soon.  Any more data that you want?
[GMT 12/02/05 23:13:22] <laptop4-g5> no now soon.  thank you
[GMT 12/02/05 23:16:37] <JorgenJensen-GV> We have traffic below, so temporarily we are stuck at 40 kft.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:16:58] <JorgenJensen-GV> Thanks for all the tropopause-theta comments. Very helpfull.

[GMT 12/02/05 23:18:31] <schanot_jeffco> OK.  Good luck.  Call me at home if you need me this weekend.  Otherwise I'll cover the Monday departure.  Stuart gave me a demo of the Diff-GPS setup.  When you pull it in tonight, just put it back in his office.

[GMT 12/02/05 23:20:48] <JorgenJensen-GV> Very large temperature excursions here; mountain waves, almost certainly. at-a went from -62 deg to -48 degrees! And then back again. Only very light turbulence.

[GMT 12/02/05 23:22:42] <cjw> satcom is stalling out/slowing down quite a bit on transers.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:23:38] <JorgenJensen-GV> D-value changed by 70 m.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:24:01] <GordonMaclean-GV> I did a stop/start of ldm on malbec 10 minutes ago - nothing was getting through.  Seems oK now
[GMT 12/02/05 23:24:24] <laptop4-g5> we are going 36K now.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:24:35] <cjw> I turned it off, so we wouldn't get duplicate stuff and to keep the 'scp' backlog flowing .....
[GMT 12/02/05 23:24:54] <cjw> (i turned it off before you turned it on)
[GMT 12/02/05 23:26:04] <GordonMaclean-GV> oops: I'll keep hands off ldm

[GMT 12/02/05 23:29:26] <JorgenJensen-GV> Back down at 36 kft; other aircraft reports turbulence below. We only have very minor turbulence, and I am pretty sure that we are just below the t-pause. Clouds, however, are still below us.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:30:59] <cjw> transfer speed is back up to par.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:32:01] <JorgenJensen-GV> Humidity has increased quite a bit here at 36 kft, so CDavis' forecast appears spot on.

[GMT 12/02/05 23:45:00] <pavel-jeffco> Same here. And on G-Earth, there is no todays flight at all.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:46:02] <cjw> ok let me look into the earth problem

[GMT 12/02/05 23:53:59] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I have the same data on both G-maps and G-earth - plane has made a bunch of transects, currently at the utah border. Flight one and flight two both show up on G-maps.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:54:49] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> The data in the database is out-of time sequence.  Caused when Gordon restarted ldm and we got new and old data.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:55:04] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I'm adding some "SORT BY" statements to my sql commands now.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:56:05] <GordonMaclean-GV> glad to be of such help :)
[GMT 12/02/05 23:56:42] <cjw> nothing like trial-by-fire.
[GMT 12/02/05 23:56:45] <GordonMaclean-GV> We just passed Catalina Island
