[GMT 12/08/05 17:22:00] <GordonMaclean-FL> If we could get them to report at something faster than  .9Hz we'd be set.
[GMT 12/08/05 17:22:17] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Gordon, ok, justa wanted to make sure it wasn't cause they were causing some other dsm headache.

[GMT 12/08/05 17:23:28] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I don't think we should look into it right now, we can use analog onboard and serial on the ground....
[GMT 12/08/05 17:24:00] <GordonMaclean-FL> Hm.  When I looked at the raw data, I did see some instances where there was no data

[GMT 12/08/05 17:25:34] <GordonMaclean-FL> Yes the deltaTs were  typically 1.09 secs, so every 10 seconds we "miss" one.

[GMT 12/08/05 17:58:28] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Hi GV, I'm going to give a quick update from Bjorn and me based on the 1700 UTC visible and IR satellite images. Just let me know if you have any questions,  or would like me to ftp the images.
[GMT 12/08/05 17:59:09] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> The region you were aiming for this morning, 125W, 42N, looks like it might clear out, and isn't very POC-like.
[GMT 12/08/05 17:59:19] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> From our view, the best POC area is in a N-S extended region further west. It has a "head" centered around 127W, 37N. 
[GMT 12/08/05 17:59:27] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> It looks like cirrus covers the southern extent of the feature though, so I'd recommend heading toward 128W,38N.
[GMT 12/08/05 17:59:33] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Between that "head" a large clear region (N-S along 125W-129W, 40N-45N), there appears to be a stripe of stratocumulus. 
[GMT 12/08/05 17:59:40] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Bjorn recommends heading to the POC first, then to the stratocumulus.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:00:11] <SteveOncley-GV> Yes, please try the ftp.  You may want to change to the &progsci group (rather than &G5, which is dealing with more technical issues.)
[GMT 12/08/05 18:00:38] <SteveOncley-GV> We had selected 130W,40N as our POC.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:00:45] <BrianMedeiros-ucla> Okay, I wasn't sure about that. I'll repost to progsci.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:01:03] <SteveOncley-GV> Don't repost -- we'll just continue there.

[GMT 12/08/05 18:33:02] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Andy,  things sound good.  The best way to know about Hal is to monitor the repeatability and noise level of the calibration and zero readings.  I'm fairly confident they're fine.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:33:21] <schanot_jeffco> Is there realy any activity on &projsci?  We don't see anyone connected.
[GMT 12/08/05 18:33:37] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Andy, for the TDL, you can look at pp2f_lhs (tropospheric channel, raw counts) and pp2f_lhl (stratospheric channel)
[GMT 12/08/05 18:33:58] <CliffHeizer-Jeffco> Andy, that number does not seem to be out of line to me.  Teresa, may have a different take since she has far more experience than I do.  Will let her know you are curious about it.

[GMT 12/08/05 19:40:26] <DeanLauritsen-GV> SteveR- the valve noise when opened seemed considerably quieter than when I did test at same altitude on G-V test flight.  As you noted, freq of sound increased as I closed the valve.
[GMT 12/08/05 19:40:30] <GordonMaclean-FL> JohnWasinger-GV, I'm not sure how long it took for 600644... to be updated to the new address, seemed faster than for the initial connection.
[GMT 12/08/05 19:42:51] <DeanLauritsen-GV> Gordon- S & T maps shows us about 90 miles off the coast now (19:46)
[GMT 12/08/05 19:43:35] <SteveR-FL1> Dean - me still thinking "Coke-bottle," and I think maybe adding deflector changed airflow characteristics enough to modify that noise. (BTW, I assume you no longer see light around the baggage door?)
[GMT 12/08/05 19:43:54] <GordonMaclean-FL> DeanLauritsen-GV, Thanks, the ground feed had to catch up after the satcom drop. It is now only 5 minutes behind.
[GMT 12/08/05 19:45:13] <AlCooper-GV> JanetScannell-Jeffco OK, now we're getting images. They are appearing in the upimages directory, but not listed in current.html so it took a minute for us to realize they are there. We now have the 1800 image. Thanks!
[GMT 12/08/05 19:46:54] <DeanLauritsen-GV> SteveR- Mark was thinking before flight that airflow streamlines are not horizontal at launcher and maybe incident angle of deflector may not be ideal. No daylight seen at baggge door...
[GMT 12/08/05 19:48:41] <SteveR-FL1> Dean - Ah, streamlines....can you see cutting up a bunch of little short pieces of yarn in your future?

[GMT 12/08/05 22:36:09] <ChuckWilson-JeffCo> Thank you Al.  The answer to the question about the return has to do with the earlier observation about hot.  If the observed heat came from the pumps, it is probably because they were operated at low altitude and did too much work.  If that is the case, then I am in favor of turning on on the return.  If the heat came from a different box (either the NMASS on top or the FCAS on the bottom, then we should leave them off.  If there is confusion con

[GMT 12/08/05 22:52:58] <ChuckWilson-JeffCo> JohnWasinger- When the plane is committed to returning to altitude, you can turn on the DU power supply.  Pleae proceed as follows:  Trun on the switch at the far right (system power - that turns on the power supply itself).  Then turn on the AC and DC for the instrument whose controls are  on the right.  Then turn on the DC only for the instrument controlled by the left switches.
