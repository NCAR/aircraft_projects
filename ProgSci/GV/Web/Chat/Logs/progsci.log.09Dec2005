[GMT 12/09/05 00:03:49] <SteveOncley-G5> Al and Dick: the pilots confirm that we did speed runs outbound at 40K' and will do another set at 45K' on return.
[GMT 12/09/05 00:04:56] <AlCooper-GV> Those who were saying this aircraft shouldn't be used for boundary layer studies should have been on this flight. It's a GREAT boundary-layer plane! Comfortable, slow enough, and even less fuel consuming than expected. Typically flying at 110 m/s or so, and control seemed easy and comfortable for the pilots. Cabin was sufficiently cool too (although we don't have much power-generating stuff in here).
[GMT 12/09/05 00:05:59] <BjornStevens-UCLA> Thats great news... in about 30 years when we are done with the RICO analysis (okay, maybe less)... it could come in handy!
[GMT 12/09/05 00:08:09] <schanot_jeffco> OK on the speed runs.  Hopefully someone is logging the times.

[GMT 12/09/05 20:33:35] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Glad you back. Having a rough flight?
[GMT 12/09/05 20:34:56] <BillIrwin-GV> naw, not bad, just some chop, bad for an airliner, nothing compared to vortex 
[GMT 12/09/05 20:35:41] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Ahhh, well we hope it will not be to rough for all the time. Still looking for a 7 hour flight?
[GMT 12/09/05 20:38:29] <BillIrwin-GV> Depends on number and type of soundings we do...I hope not, as that would put me over crew duty day...
[GMT 12/09/05 20:39:26] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, well just let me know when you are heading back.  If we get time tonight we will start the DSM work.
