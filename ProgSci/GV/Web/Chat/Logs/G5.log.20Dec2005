[GMT 12/20/05 18:45:26] <DaveR-G5> Mark- wilco. Our plan is to drop at 0.8 Mach and FL 300, once we are over the sea.

[GMT 12/20/05 19:22:24] <DeanLauritsen-GV> drop 3 away a few minutes ago and looking good; number four loaded, waiting to roll out of turn before I launch
[GMT 12/20/05 19:25:34] <DeanLauritsen-GV> drop 4 away and looks good.  All 4 drops from FL31, Mach 0.8.  All four looking normal in the data.
