[GMT 12/19/05 13:37:29] <jwilson_> chris -  what does the window on the right mean then?  Lots of people are listed including Janet - are they not on?

[GMT 12/19/05 13:42:50] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> DaveR-Jeffco google stuff then updates every 30 seconds and doesn't use all data points, I thnk just every 15th point/second.

[GMT 12/19/05 13:44:52] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> I also believe there is about a 30 second delay between plane and ground.
[GMT 12/19/05 13:46:15] <JohnWasinger-g5> ChrisWebster-MangyMoose, was that the aeros bug where it crashed when setting the begin tine too early on the time series plots?

[GMT 12/19/05 13:49:36] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> JohnWasinger-g5 yes, though that wasn't the exact problem.  problem was when all the data for given variable was "missing data".
[GMT 12/19/05 13:50:22] <JohnWasinger-g5> jwilson, see how RonRuth-BJC is grayed out?  that means he typed /away to denote that he is logged in but not at his terminal...

[GMT 12/19/05 13:59:40] <DaveR-Jeffco> Looks like you crossed into stratosphere ~13:54, before you began climb.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:00:28] <JohnWasinger-g5> prake data looks good... 2005 12 19 14:03:38.115 022      48     -92.88     -77.79     -61.64     -58.56     -42.78      -44.1     -40.89     -33.63     -29.83      -22.9     -7.429    -0.5677

[GMT 12/19/05 14:07:36] <jwilson> shanhu -  please update on the nmass status
[GMT 12/19/05 14:13:39] <JohnWasinger-g5> DaveR-Jeffco, when crusing should we see a gradiant on the values reported by the prake?  that is more negative pressure values closer to to aircraft hull becoming positive for the sensors further away
[GMT 12/19/05 14:17:09] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> DaveR-Jeffco I Think prake is being mirrored to the ground.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:23:49] <shanhu-g5> Good morning chuck, nmass is good.   But look at outside here,  there is twilight!!! very depressing light!!
[GMT 12/19/05 14:25:25] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, we kept chatting to you. BUt i was in Progressive rather than G5. So i didn't see you until now
[GMT 12/19/05 14:28:00] <shanhu-g5> Dave,  please give me tropopause heigth in Montana and Canada!!
[GMT 12/19/05 14:28:23] <shanhu-g5> Do you need lat/long infor for those locations??

[GMT 12/19/05 14:33:47] <jwilson> shanhu - I expected an earlier take off and an earlier return - The 14:00 eta-jeffco makes it very hard for me to do what I have to do today -  Please consider an earlier turn around (15 - 30 minutes) so that I can get the instruments off in time.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:34:39] <shanhu-g5> OK- chuck!
[GMT 12/19/05 14:35:03] <DaveR-Jeffco> JohnW- yes, the rake pressures are negative with the largest negative values for prake12[0]. And the reason is that the velocity is smallest close to the aircraft skin.

[GMT 12/19/05 14:42:19] <jwilson> shanhu - would you like to be in the troposphere?  I would think that that would be more interesting for the light/dark comparison

[GMT 12/19/05 14:45:39] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, we are in stratosphere very close to tropopause!!  I agree with you!!!
[GMT 12/19/05 14:49:16] <shanhu-g5> daveR - your wcpc is saturated.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:54:20] <jwilson> shanhu - can you ask to decrease altitude so that you pass into the troposphere?  Can you try to stay in the trop?
[GMT 12/19/05 14:55:31] <DaveR-Jeffco> Shan-Hu: not sure what you mean, wcpc is saturated.  Flow controls and pressures look okay. Conc values are reasonable, ~200 to 1000 and have been fluctuating. Current conc ~40/cc seems very low.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:56:15] <shanhu-g5> I meant signal  - but now they got back to my screen..
[GMT 12/19/05 14:57:14] <shanhu-g5> Chuck - past one hr or so we were in trop,,, it seems we are now at Troposphere though.  Any particular reason to stay in trop?
[GMT 12/19/05 14:58:59] schanot_jeffco (schanot@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:01:06] <jwilson> shanhu - I believe that our latitudional survey is best carried out with significant flight legs just below the tropopause as we discussed earlier.  It will be wetter, nearly as cold and therefore more favorable for new particle formation.  
[GMT 12/19/05 15:02:23] <shanhu-g5> Chuck - i agree, therefore, we trying to staying in troposphere but close to tropopause just 1 km below..
[GMT 12/19/05 15:03:02] ChrisWebster-Jeffco (cjw@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:03:27] <shanhu-g5> But, the predictions were tricky today.. there was a narrow band of low tropopause in Montana, and it has moved since yesterday,, so we went to stratosphere for a while.

[GMT 12/19/05 15:11:58] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, and now the sun is bright here outside... I cannot believe it!
[GMT 12/19/05 15:19:08] <pavel-jeffco> shanhu-g5: you will move out of the sunlit zone shortly, according to the map of sunlight. You may still stay in twilight zone but it will not be bright.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:19:41] <shanhu-g5> Thanks Pave!  That's a good news.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:20:02] <shanhu-g5> PaveL
[GMT 12/19/05 15:21:12] <pavel-jeffco> The way I see it, the entire flight plan was to follow the twilight zone, if you look at te map. The only place you'd get into darkness would be the northernmost point of flight.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:23:38] <shanhu-g5> I see,,, I didn't twilight is quite bright..  In addition, the high altitude also affects our calculations.

[GMT 12/19/05 15:27:55] <shanhu-g5> DaveR -- what is the tropouse height at 61N 115 W; 62N 114W ??
[GMT 12/19/05 15:31:02] <pavel-jeffco> 10 km altitude gives about 15 min shift in sun's disk exposure. Twilight zone appears to expand by 30 min. Start of twilight at 10 km at Yellowknife is 9:18 MST.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:31:47] <shanhu-g5> If DaveR is not there - AlSchanot/Pavel, can you look for real time tropopause for the above two locations?

[GMT 12/19/05 16:02:35] <jwilson_> shanhu -  if staying at the same altitudes does not achieve your scientific objectives, then change the altitudes.  I am willing to sacrifice some latitude for time - Particularly in view of the arcitic data that we already have -  it is the northern mid latitudes that we are short on and that this flight addresses
