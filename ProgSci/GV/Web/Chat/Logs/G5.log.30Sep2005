[GMT 09/30/05 15:53:27] <ChrisWebster-FL> it was restarted for the ground transmission.

[GMT 09/30/05 16:20:19] <ChrisWebster-FL2> About time.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:20:19] <Jcowan-Jeffco> It seemed slow from where we were.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:20:51] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Hey that plane ain't made ian on time take off yet.  What do you expect?
[GMT 09/30/05 16:20:51] <BillIrwin-g5> I think we did slow down some...don't know why
[GMT 09/30/05 16:20:59] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:21:29] <BillIrwin-g5> john, you see my earlier comment ttlh2 dipped at take off, then just came back as we increased speed after our climb out
[GMT 09/30/05 16:22:19] <BillIrwin-g5> chris, why does the track change seemingly automatic, the zoom, kind of a pain
[GMT 09/30/05 16:22:25] <Jcowan-Jeffco> No I did not see that.  I just got chat up.  I'll let Kurt know.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:23:28] <BillIrwin-g5> john, i believe it could be a part of the "kluge" that Dave put together, I wonder if something is shifting, phycially inside the ttlh 2 part
[GMT 09/30/05 16:24:04] <Jcowan-Jeffco> That is possible.  It was TTLH2 again correct?
[GMT 09/30/05 16:24:09] <ChrisWebster-FL2> Restate, didn't comprehend..
[GMT 09/30/05 16:26:03] <BillIrwin-g5> it was TTLH2, the same as last flight
[GMT 09/30/05 16:28:43] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, boss is out right now but I will let him know.  Has it come back yet?

[GMT 09/30/05 16:34:53] <Jcowan-Jeffco> JW: the sensor elements are the same.  There are two elements in each probe.  On TTLH one of them we have had a problem on for this and the last flight.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:35:15] <BillIrwin-g5> temp probes are agreeing with each other the best i've seen so far, especially at these cold temps..
[GMT 09/30/05 16:36:01] <Jcowan-Jeffco> That is good to hear.  Maybe the new calibration helped out.  Al seemed to indicate that maybe the bath cal was slightly off also.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:36:10] <BillIrwin-g5> warmer temps they still were at least 2 degrees apart between the worst two
[GMT 09/30/05 16:36:40] <BillIrwin-g5> hard to have the bath cal be off...it's pretty precise 
[GMT 09/30/05 16:37:34] Nick change: RonRuth -> RonRuth-BJC
[GMT 09/30/05 16:37:36] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I'll let him tell you about that.  I think we still just need to tweek things a bit.  I'm not sure that everything is working up to snuff yet.

[GMT 09/30/05 16:42:30] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Well we got until we fly Prog Sci to get it worked out.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:43:23] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Do we have data on the grond this flight and if so how do I access it?

[GMT 09/30/05 16:56:37] <friesen> Cowan:: Would you find out from jorgen or al what they want to do on the 1000' leg? Staged speeds? What speeds?
[GMT 09/30/05 16:57:28] <RonRuth-BJC> Allen wants staged speed runs with 6 speeds, same as yesterday.
[GMT 09/30/05 16:58:01] <ChrisWebster-FL2> friesen, Where do you plan to do 1000' speed run?
[GMT 09/30/05 16:58:22] <RonRuth-BJC> Allen will be providing speeds presently.
[GMT 09/30/05 17:00:59] <friesen> Ron: We may not be able to do 6. What arefavorite 3? We wiil do six if time allows. Reverse leg?
[GMT 09/30/05 17:02:16] <friesen> Chris: 1000' over Neb - where else?
[GMT 09/30/05 17:02:37] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Chris: Thanks I got Areos to work.
[GMT 09/30/05 17:02:47] <RonRuth-BJC> Allen:  Change of plan after talking with Jorgen:  Stage speed run: 4 speed legs (90-270 turn) 220, 235, 245, 270 (ADC speeds)

[GMT 09/30/05 17:35:48] <BillIrwin-g5> rubber soled shoes!, starting pitch manuvers...things looking well, including all temps so far
[GMT 09/30/05 17:39:43] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Good to hear.  I got the data to disply on my computer.
[GMT 09/30/05 18:08:36] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Looks like TTLH2 just had a big problem?
[GMT 09/30/05 18:09:58] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Looks like it is tied to turbulance.
[GMT 09/30/05 18:11:05] <ads-G5> should be TTRH1
[GMT 09/30/05 18:13:57] <ChrisWebster-FL2> friesen, Oh, I thought you ment ASL, not AGL.
[GMT 09/30/05 18:15:45] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Yep... That is TTRH1.  Not even the same sensor.  This could be fun to find.
[GMT 09/30/05 18:16:07] <Jcowan-Jeffco> How is the ride?  Looks a little rough.
[GMT 09/30/05 18:17:26] <BillIrwin-g5> getting rough, ttrh1 has been in and out, in the bumps, i believe the board itself (amp) has too many solder on parts to handle the airplane ride...problem keeps switching from temp probe and amp too much
[GMT 09/30/05 18:18:25] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I'm not sure we can say for sure until we get a good board in and fly it.
[GMT 09/30/05 18:27:39] <BillIrwin-g5> i agree
[GMT 09/30/05 18:34:16] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Do you have an ETA yet?
