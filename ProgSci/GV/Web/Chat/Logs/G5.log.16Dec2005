[GMT 12/16/05 15:35:02] <pavel-jeffco> jeff - I was told you tried to get a hold of me?
[GMT 12/16/05 15:36:11] <jwilson> shanhu -  when the nmass fails, it is only necessary to cycle power to the nmass only.  you can leave power on the fcas.
[GMT 12/16/05 15:36:17] <shanhu-g5> Chuck -- No, it didn't come up...  Failed again in 1-2 min..  I switched off them entirely
[GMT 12/16/05 15:36:34] <ads-G5> Jeff is not on chat.
[GMT 12/16/05 15:36:52] <pavel-jeffco> ads-G5 - what was it?

[GMT 12/16/05 15:37:16] <jwilson> shanhu -  you can leave it off until the aircraft is ready to climb to higher altitudes.  then lets try it again.
[GMT 12/16/05 15:37:20] <ads-G5> We had truoble getting the differential GPS up.
[GMT 12/16/05 15:37:33] <pavel-jeffco> So, did it work?
[GMT 12/16/05 15:38:16] <ads-G5> They called Stuart and he made sure that it was up correctly.  They were satisfied so we took off.

[GMT 12/16/05 15:57:05] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> WCN looks okay. We are flying race-track pattern, left circulation, and see repeating spike ofCN on final approach. Don't know what the source is, since winds are northerly ~5m/s. The town and powerplant are south east.
[GMT 12/16/05 15:58:48] <ads-G5> Going to try and find the 130 now.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:00:12] <ads-G5> Has the 130 left jeffco yet?
[GMT 12/16/05 16:01:02] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> First set of passes at 3v4 were at different speeds. Last two passes were with left rudder and right rudder.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:01:58] <JanetScannell-Jeffco> The C130 just headed out.  They won't be on chat today.  Problems with the Iridium phone on board.

[GMT 12/16/05 16:04:11] <JanetScannell-Jeffco> ads-G5: satcom phone not working on c130, so no track from c130.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:04:30] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> Low ceilings during work at Ft Morgan, but well above 1000 agl = plenty of space for us.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:04:35] <ads-G5> Okay thanks.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:07:22] <shanhu-g5> Chuck-- the computers in G5 are all bolted in the rack and there are no enogh spaces to put the flash disk in these computers.. So that plan didn't work.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:07:53] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> Pressure rake is making data -- looks ok.

[GMT 12/16/05 16:13:21] <jwilson> Shanhu -  we are learning a lot from the fail light -  something is not working!!!!!  If you did bring your lap top - or if someone else did -  perhaps you could copy the diagn.asc file after one of the failures.

[GMT 12/16/05 16:13:46] <ads-G5> In comms with 130. They are heading east from Fort Collins.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:14:10] <jwilson> shanhu-when is the plane due back at jeffco?
[GMT 12/16/05 16:14:11] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> CO is also making data. Values now ~110 ppbv on its display. CO volts on aeros generally steady 0.001v ocnl spike .01.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:14:33] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Thanks, Dave, for the CO update.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:16:04] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> pitch and sideslip maneuvers at ~10kft are nicely resolved on data system. Looks like sideslip is affecting both wind speed and direction values.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:16:43] <ads-G5> Starting speed run.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:16:44] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, i think it is around 2 PM?? Is that right? Al-Schanot/Pavel?
[GMT 12/16/05 16:17:31] <ads-G5> Last work I had was 1400 but we left late.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:18:11] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> static pressures ok. PHIM1 and PHIM2 track others, but show ocnl blips on otherwise smooth traces. Blips also seen on rf07.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:19:19] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, we are in 500 mb/4-5 km zone.  I am going to try to run instruments once more.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:26:30] <pavel-jeffco> I am trying to see Stuart down on the ground in Ft. Morgan, but GoogleEarth does not have enough resolution :-(
[GMT 12/16/05 16:27:10] <ads-G5> If you did see himit would have been a couple of years ago.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:32:43] <jwilson> shanhu, is the nmass still running?
[GMT 12/16/05 16:41:16] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> Speed runs show affect on static pressures psf, psrake, apcn, phim1/2; some are +offset, some are -. Speed does not affect ps_a.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:42:34] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> aeros ver 3196 on avaps (WinXP) has been solid since take-off. 
[GMT 12/16/05 16:45:15] <ads-G5> Going to meet the Herc.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:46:14] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, they are running well so far for the last 20 min.  I take this as good news!
[GMT 12/16/05 16:49:33] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> Flow control on new WCN looks good; values for both sample and total flow are within ~1% so far. 
[GMT 12/16/05 16:50:09] <ads-G5> Have 130 in sight.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:50:52] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, i also checked with the screen,,, the number look good and meaningful. 
[GMT 12/16/05 16:51:30] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, ch1 220, ch2 50 etc., for Hz numbers
[GMT 12/16/05 16:56:00] <jwilson> shanhu -  I am glad the NMASS seems to be working.  We will see how often the NMASS fails and this will determine what we do this afternoon.  If it continues to operate, then we will probably try to fly Monday AM as is with you watching the faill light and cycling power when it fails.  If it fails frequently, then we can pull it off this afternoon and take it to DU for diagnosis and treatment.  Under that scenario we would have it back on the GV saturday
[GMT 12/16/05 16:56:00] <jwilson>  afternoon.  If we failed to diagnose and fix by saturday afternoon, we will have to cancel the monday AM new particle formation flight.  So please keep track of when it fails so we can talk about what to do.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:56:15] <ads-G5> Following 130 in trail.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:58:17] <shanhu-g5> Chuck - we will be at 2-2.5 km for 30 min.  But I will keep run them.
[GMT 12/16/05 16:59:41] <jwilson> I agree, keep them running -  but do note the pump temperature - they can be too hot to leave your hand on them comfortably, but they should not be too hot to touch.
[GMT 12/16/05 17:00:47] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> GV is on C130 r-wing and slightly behind. Starting fist comparison run, alt 7600ft, eastbd.
[GMT 12/16/05 17:01:00] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, OK!  I think it is running well  - by looking at the Hz numbers
[GMT 12/16/05 17:02:12] <jwilson> can the GV sample some c130 exhaust?
[GMT 12/16/05 17:04:10] <shanhu-g5> I was thinking of the same thing... because the particle numbers are very high (>1000 ch1 !!)
[GMT 12/16/05 17:05:12] <shanhu-g5> Although, again, altitudes are low.
[GMT 12/16/05 17:06:00] <AVAPS-DaveR-G5> Chuck- we asked for a couple of passes through C130 wake -- should be able to see with aerosol, CO, and turbulence.
[GMT 12/16/05 17:07:02] <jwilson> shanhu -  1000 is not a high reading for nmass - I am pretty sure you are reading Hz on that output-in an exhaust plume, you should see many times that number.
[GMT 12/16/05 17:07:20] <jwilson> dave-R:  good that will be interesting -  thanks
[GMT 12/16/05 17:07:41] <shanhu-g5> yes, they are higher than that - with fluctuations..
[GMT 12/16/05 17:08:16] <jwilson> shanhu - I am glad things are working!!!
[GMT 12/16/05 17:08:47] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, I hope so !!

[GMT 12/16/05 19:20:42] <jwilson> shanhu -I  interpret the chat flow as suggesting that the GV is 30 minutes from Jeffco and that the NMASS has run continuously for 3 hrs.  therefore, I suggest that we leave the nmass on the GV and do a preflight tomorrow at about 11 am.  I suggest we fly on monday as is.  You can monitor the instrument and restart it as needed.  It does not look like it will reqiure too many restarts.  Do you agree? 
[GMT 12/16/05 19:22:10] <shanhu-g5> chuck, i agree.
[GMT 12/16/05 19:23:05] <shanhu-g5> Chuck, will we also go through the FCAS data reduction tomorrow  -- as tomorrow is the only day we can do this before my departure
