[GMT 09/27/05 15:16:38] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> Gordon?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:21:41] <maclean> that's me
[GMT 09/27/05 15:23:27] <maclean> Chris,  I can't log into sloop.  If you have time could you check it out?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:23:44] ads-G5 (ads@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:23:55] <maclean> satcom is up?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:25:01] <ads-G5> yes, we're on the ramp.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:25:05] <ads-G5> fueling.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:25:09] <ads-G5> this is chris
[GMT 09/27/05 15:25:17] <ads-G5> i'm not flying
[GMT 09/27/05 15:25:27] <maclean> Oh-oh.  Who is?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:26:20] <maclean> Did the default route come up automatically?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:26:37] <maclean> What's the IP?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:27:49] <ads-G5> 12.111.57.46
[GMT 09/27/05 15:27:53] <ads-G5> try it
[GMT 09/27/05 15:28:46] <maclean> I'm in
[GMT 09/27/05 15:29:55] <maclean> On shutdown, ask the techs to double click the mpds stop (adsl-stop) icon.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:30:05] <ads-G5> ok
[GMT 09/27/05 15:30:28] <maclean> Otherwise if we just shutdown the server we lose the ppp messages about connect time and bytes sent.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:31:55] <ads-G5> 10-4.  Last flight I typed shutdown on my laptop, except I was logged into hyper.  D'oh.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:34:20] <ads-G5> Do you want to get the ldm updated Gordon?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:35:43] <maclean> Do we want to send ldm data?  I think so, but probably more people than me should be
[GMT 09/27/05 15:35:45] <maclean> looking at it.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:35:52] <ads-G5> p.s.  Do we need any svn updates from the ADS3 stuff?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:36:43] <maclean> No I think we're ok.  The only change that isn't on the plane are some comments in the xml
[GMT 09/27/05 15:37:06] <ads-G5> what about that one mesnor or whatever ?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:38:48] <maclean> The pressure sensors should be OK.  When will dsm_server be started?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:40:29] <ads-G5> as soon as john can type +180 into thdg & wd, signed exasperated.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:41:02] <maclean> Oh
[GMT 09/27/05 15:41:46] <maclean> Are you going to send ldm data?  Should we start it now?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:43:36] <ads-G5> I can., I'll need to restart nimbus, but no biggy.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:43:54] <ads-G5> dsm_server should be up.  Check things out on your end .
[GMT 09/27/05 15:45:11] <maclean> data_stats looks good.  Paro pressure is coming in.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:46:30] <maclean> I just rserial'd to the first mensor and saw that the internal filter coef is right
[GMT 09/27/05 15:47:45] <ads-G5> display not working at the moment, no clients can ping hyper.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:47:50] <maclean> Do we need to scrub/move the sql files on malbel:~ldm/data/files
[GMT 09/27/05 15:48:20] <ads-G5> yes.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:49:15] <maclean> Remember that win PCs might have to use hyper.gv.ucar.edu
[GMT 09/27/05 15:50:14] <ads-G5> I think they booted the laptops before the server.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:50:20] <ads-G5> no dhcp at that point
[GMT 09/27/05 15:50:22] <maclean> D'oh
[GMT 09/27/05 15:51:13] <ads-G5> ldm server onboard started.
[GMT 09/27/05 15:51:28] <maclean> wait, I haven't moved the files
[GMT 09/27/05 15:52:24] <maclean> OK, the previous flight is in /h/guest/ldm/data/files/GV_old
[GMT 09/27/05 15:52:41] <maclean> I'll change the IP in ldm.conf and restart it
[GMT 09/27/05 15:53:47] <maclean> Done
[GMT 09/27/05 15:55:01] <ads-G5> good on the save
[GMT 09/27/05 15:55:22] <ads-G5> does ~ldm/logs/ldmd.log say it connected to hyper?
[GMT 09/27/05 15:56:20] <maclean> I've forgotten all the ldm commands I figured out last flight....
[GMT 09/27/05 15:56:31] <maclean> I don't see anything in the log
[GMT 09/27/05 15:57:18] <ads-G5> I have to get off.  I'll restart nimbus with retrans.
[GMT 09/27/05 16:05:41] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> I'm inhouse
[GMT 09/27/05 16:07:39] <maclean> I'm back, got my cup o joe and a fritter, ready to chat.
[GMT 09/27/05 16:07:57] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> ldmd.log hasn't updated in 3 days.
[GMT 09/27/05 16:08:35] <maclean> I'm not sure that that's about. I'm using ldadmin:

[GMT 09/27/05 16:10:26] <maclean> I don't see anything yet, did see a radar png file.
[GMT 09/27/05 16:11:26] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> did you hup it, restart it, or stop then start it?  I've only gotten the latter to work...
[GMT 09/27/05 16:11:35] <maclean> Who's on the plane - MikeD, that you?

[GMT 09/27/05 17:35:09] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I'm glad that it worked for you.
[GMT 09/27/05 17:35:29] <ads-G5> well we're having fun now, still doing circles and speed runs, next we get down and dirty somewhere down below us, coming up in about 10 minutes or so
[GMT 09/27/05 17:36:26] <Jcowan-Jeffco> It would be nice if we had ION from you guys.  I like having the track data.
[GMT 09/27/05 17:36:51] <maclean> We're working on getting the data transfered down here so we can run aeros
[GMT 09/27/05 17:36:58] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> we have something better.
[GMT 09/27/05 17:37:24] <wasinger> When I added +180 to the IRS wind direction true I in advertently added 180 to the IRS track angle true
[GMT 09/27/05 17:38:44] <wasinger> There is also the BCD version if wind direction (that we currently don't use) of label 0016
[GMT 09/27/05 17:40:31] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> John the old IRS was in Pirad not Degrees....
[GMT 09/27/05 17:40:45] <maclean> Carefull, generally you don't want to add 180, you and 360 if dir is negative
[GMT 09/27/05 17:41:10] <maclean> and should have been "add 360"
[GMT 09/27/05 17:45:00] <wasinger> Chris: the native units on the GV's IRS is in degrees for the true heading and wind direction true
[GMT 09/27/05 17:47:36] <maclean> Are the directions 180 deg wrong, or do you just want to convert negative values to 
[GMT 09/27/05 17:48:45] <maclean> positive. 
[GMT 09/27/05 17:50:33] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> John do you know what direction zero degrees is supposed to be?
[GMT 09/27/05 17:51:03] <wasinger> Chris: the native units on the GV's IRS is in degrees for the true heading and wind direction true/
[GMT 09/27/05 17:51:38] <wasinger> sorry slipped on the arrow key..
[GMT 09/27/05 17:51:40] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> I understand, but which does zero degrees point?  North, south, east?
[GMT 09/27/05 17:51:46] <ChrisWebster-NCAR> oh
