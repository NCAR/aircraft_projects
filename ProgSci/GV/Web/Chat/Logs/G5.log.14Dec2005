[GMT 12/14/05 16:49:55] <DaveR-Jeffco> (adding to Jeff's reply to Al): The dropsonde computer (WinXP) gets serial feed of lat/lon/altitude/etc.  DeanL wrote code to reformat a subset of those data so that it conforms to standard GPS serial data; and those pseudo-GPS data feed Microsoft Street and Trip program. Result is real-time overlay on detailed earth map.

[GMT 12/14/05 16:52:14] <AlCooper-G5> DaveR: seems easy enough, hope we can get it for front-cabin use on our screens sometime. For what we're doing now, it would be really handy.

[GMT 12/14/05 18:11:43] <DaveR-Jeffco> Middle line radar tops are 35000ft and cell movement from NW at 25kt.  The other line, near Houston, has max tops 50,000ft and movement from SW at 40kt.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:13:53] <DaveR-Jeffco> If you are on intercom that has control buttons, you can monitor VHF transmissions. The pilots can also get voice recorded wx (HIWAS) from selected VOR stations, and you can monitor that on NAV.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:15:34] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Britt, did Cliff happen to mention that we don't want to sample CO during cloud penetrations?

[GMT 12/14/05 18:19:50] <AlCooper-G5> Thanks, Allen. At this point, I was concerned enough about that line of TRW at Houston that I downloaded the image from the RAP site. I think we'll be turning back short of the coast. Laura and Mel are working on an alternate plan now.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:20:06] <schanot_jeffco> Color IR image indicates cld top temps in southern OKaround -50 to -55C.  That would put them around your current altitude.

[GMT 12/14/05 18:21:32] <AlCooper-G5> Dave: Thanks for that information. Just what we needed. We see reflectivities of 55 dBz in the line, so (esp. without trust in the onboard radar) were going to turn around. The SIGMET did get through. I don't think we want to go through that.

[GMT 12/14/05 18:33:21] <JanetScannell-Jeffco> AlCooper-G5: You should be getting the images now that Al Schanot sent.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:34:01] <schanot_jeffco> I can't find dave at the moment, but the hard echos start on a line between Shreveport and San Antonio
[GMT 12/14/05 18:36:23] <DaveR-> standy by -- I'll look.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:37:52] <schanot_jeffco> If you stay east of Fort Worth, the more northerly line should not be a factor.  All returns less that 30 dBZ in that line and those W of FW.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:39:19] <schanot_jeffco> Janet says all 4 images have now been transfered.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:42:28] <DaveR-> Radar shows lack of echoes between lines. This gap is centered over Austin and runs SW-NE. Satellite loop suggests gap is visually open also. Looks like you could continue south and get vertical profile near Austin.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:43:58] <JohnWasinger-GV> DaveR-, your paste on the weather data flooded this channel...  To prevent flooding simply /join a new channel, then announce the new channel name on this channel then paste the message there.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:44:53] <JohnWasinger-GV> DaveR-, ...after you notice that LauraPan-GV, MelShapiro-GV, and AlCooper-G5 have joined it.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:47:47] <AlCooper-G5> Dave - Thanks for that, we're going to try to descend in the region east of Waco (going right through a holding pattern for a major airport at a time of weather delays at that airport!) -- we'll see if they let us descend...
[GMT 12/14/05 18:49:12] <AlCooper-G5> Janet: Thanks, images are here now.
[GMT 12/14/05 18:50:42] <DaveR-> Looks like the echo-free (nearly cloud free) region extends from there to a bit past San Antonio.

[GMT 12/14/05 19:35:35] <MelShapiro-GV> Considering profie atsouth of convection
[GMT 12/14/05 19:41:35] <DaveR-> ads - see occasional noise on analog signals PHIM1 and PHIM2. These are from small pressure sensors in aerosol rack and connect to dsm308.
[GMT 12/14/05 19:46:04] <LauraPan-GV> it seems we are going to be landing a lot earlier
[GMT 12/14/05 19:49:42] <schanot_jeffco> Al - An Aeromet rep - the guy who put the thing together - will arrive by tomorrow and supervize some mods to remove some constrictions.
[GMT 12/14/05 19:50:19] <schanot_jeffco> They will also work on the wiring problem.  Hope is to re-install on Saturday and test ASAP.
[GMT 12/14/05 19:51:25] <AlCooper-G5> Allen: Thankis, that's good news.
[GMT 12/14/05 19:52:32] <schanot_jeffco> After the monday mission, we need to give furhter dropsonde testing a high priority.

[GMT 12/14/05 20:45:42] <ads-G5> Sounds like we will be heading back to JeffCo a little early, no ETA yet

[GMT 12/14/05 20:58:12] <AlCooper-G5> Jeff, I asked Ed and he said they could see echoes, esp. in target mode, but it didn't seem to match what they were seeing visually so they were pretty uncomfortable with it.
[GMT 12/14/05 20:59:01] <ads-G5> The eta about 45 minutes until we land or less
[GMT 12/14/05 20:59:35] <LauraPan-GV> KenBowman-TAMU, sorry to miss ur early msg. We had to turn around early to avoid that 50Kft convection
[GMT 12/14/05 21:00:23] <LauraPan-GV> BillRandel_MesaLab, we are at 385K right now 
[GMT 12/14/05 21:00:50] <AlCooper-G5> Allen: we will be returning once we complete our climb to 47kft. We're close now, but we're also close to home so there may be some delay while we finish the climb and then descend. We will probably be back in 15-30 min in either case. (Slow climbing here at 45kft)
