Dec 08 10:47:57 <SteveOncley-GV>	Hi Brian -- could you test sending the latest satellite images to us?   We are using pac-northwest visible.  Thanks.
Dec 08 10:58:54 <SteveOncley-GV>	BrianMedeiros-ucla Are you looking at chat in &progsci?
Dec 08 11:05:51 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	I'll send the satellite image in just a second. I'll repost our summary here now.
Dec 08 11:06:06 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	From our view, the best POC area is in a N-S extended region further west. It has a "head" centered around 127W, 37N. 
Dec 08 11:06:12 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	It looks like cirrus covers the southern extent of the feature though, so I'd recommend heading toward 128W,38N.
Dec 08 11:06:18 <SteveOncley-GV>	okay -- I'll watch for the images.
Dec 08 11:06:18 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Between that "head" a large clear region (N-S along 125W-129W, 40N-45N), there appears to be a stripe of stratocumulus. 
Dec 08 11:06:18 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Bjorn recommends heading to the POC first, then to the stratocumulus.
Dec 08 11:09:06 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Okay, I think the file should be on its way. Let me know if you never get it.
Dec 08 11:09:53 <SteveOncley-GV>	If I understand the process, it should arrive shortly after 11:10 here (even 5-minute boundary), so very soon.
Dec 08 11:12:24 <SteveOncley-GV>	Nothing yet, we may have to wait to 11:15...
Dec 08 11:15:02 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	In the meantime, I'm going to also try to send the 1730 image too, just the region of interest.

Dec 08 11:17:30 <SteveOncley-GV>	JanetScannell-Jeffco :Are you able to monitor this transfer?  http://hyper/upimages/current.html only has the "latest image" text 8 minutes after UCLA tried the upload.
Dec 08 11:20:25 <JanetScannell-Jeffco>	The progsci_1700UTC.gif image has been put into the ldm.  I am currently checking to see if the image has gotten to malbec and from there to the GV.

Dec 08 12:18:12 <AlCooper-GV>	We (Steve Oncley and I) were apparently not receiving chat for a few minutes. Maybe related, I downloaded the image directly from the web site because we needed it for flight planning, so we have that now (the 1730 image). If there were messages to us in the last 10 min or so, we probably missed them
Dec 08 12:20:56 <GordonMaclean-FL>	The satcom network connection dropped and has been re-established
Dec 08 12:23:25 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	The 1800 image is available, should I try to ftp it to you?
Dec 08 12:27:23 <AlCooper-GV>	Yes, we'd welcome an update (in case we get the upload from the ground to work). I'm reluctant to upload another image outside the planned link unless it looks like we need it. Do you see significant change that would affect our planning? (We have adjusted the target point to 129W 40N on the basis of the image we got.)

Dec 08 12:29:31 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	There's nothing too surprising in the 1800 image. 129W, 40N seems like a good target for now. It might be optimal to go a little south of 40N once you get closer.
Dec 08 12:31:13 ---	ChrisWebster-G5 is now known as SteveOncley-GV
Dec 08 12:32:38 <SteveOncley-GV>	Yeah, we are aware of the option to go south once we get to 40N129W.
Dec 08 12:35:22 <AlCooper-GV>	Now flying over the coast. All looks well for now.
Dec 08 12:35:28 <AlCooper-GV>	A couple of data notes follow:
Dec 08 12:35:50 <AlCooper-GV>	(1) temperatures are all in reasonable agreement, and all about 5C colder than AT_A
Dec 08 12:36:33 <AlCooper-GV>	(2) dewpoints still show the 10s cycle to negative-max in the plots and ASCII listings, but curiously not in stats for aeros which displays a reasonable mean and variance
Dec 08 12:37:07 <AlCooper-GV>	(3) DPs have shown surprising ability to track changes even at very low humidity, and the changes appear real in comparison to TDL counts
Dec 08 12:38:20 <AlCooper-GV>	(4) Chris changed the PALT calculation before the flight, and pressure altitude is now in agreement with the cockpit
Dec 08 12:40:42 <AlCooper-GV>	making a strong contrail, by the way. Visible in ground shadow. Nice glories visible in lower clouds also.
Dec 08 12:41:43 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	That reminds me... Bjorn says to take good notes and lots of photos.

Dec 08 14:12:17 <AlCooper-GV>	satellite communications are back now. We;'re in a low-level circle, about 150 ft, below a mostly open area in these clouds.
Dec 08 14:13:46 <AlCooper-GV>	-117.55, 40.35 lat-l;ong at present, at the northern extent of the circle
Dec 08 14:14:45 <laptop1-g5>	(from DaveR on GV) CONCN came alive ~21:04 when I turned on its pump. It has had some flow through it, but apparently will not send conc data unless pump is on. 
Dec 08 14:15:52 <laptop1-g5>	(from DaveR-GV) CONCN ~200-300/cc is reasonable value. Flow is still less than target, but CN appears to be making useful data.

Dec 08 14:18:43 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	By any chance has the 2000UTC satellite image made it to the GV yet? I ftp'd it while satcom was down.

Dec 08 14:24:17 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	The extended POC we were watching seems to have moved south and west. There is a N-S region of open cells right along 130W, from about 41N going to south of 37N. A good cloud boundary is to your west as well, before the POC, at maybe 129.5W.
Dec 08 14:25:53 <AlCooper-GV>	Brian, thanks, we now have the 2000 image here. Steve and Don are coordinating this circle, so haven't had time to look at it yet.

Dec 08 14:33:24 <SteveOncley-GV>	We are now at 39.7N, 127.6W, which looks to me like the best place in the 20Z image you sent up.  Just finishing circle #1,
Dec 08 14:34:54 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Do you think you got through the POC earlier... from our vantage point it looks like you might have been a little north and east of it. And do you need anything from us?
Dec 08 14:37:50 <SteveOncley-GV>	I think we're pretty well committed at this point.  This patch seems pretty uniform -- probably not as much cloud as you'd like, but I don't think going a bit south would have changed things significantly.  Don't know how much more you can do for us.  Thanks!
Dec 08 14:39:13 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Okay, I'll send the 2100 satellite image when it is available, so you can check things out. How much more time do you have?
Dec 08 14:40:16 <SteveOncley-GV>	About another 2 hours.
Dec 08 14:51:08 ---	laptop1-g5 is now known as JohnWasinger-GV
Dec 08 14:57:15 <ChrisWebster-Jeffco>	SteveOncley-GV how big is your current circle (in minutes)?
Dec 08 14:59:27 <AlCooper-GV>	Chris: Steve's pretty busy now. Looks like the circle took about 30 min or so.
Dec 08 14:59:38 <SteveOncley-GV>	We're always flying 30min circles.  With an airspeed of about 220knots, it should be about 0.5degree in diameter.
Dec 08 15:01:44 ---	kurt-ads is now known as DaveR-GV
Dec 08 15:03:44 <DaveR-GV>	Shan-Hu & ChuckW - the plate that your pumps are mounted on is getting quite hot. I can touch it but wouldn't want to leave my hand there more than 1s. One pump is making most of the heat (outboard side of rack). Other pumps are also hot (RDMA for example).

Dec 08 15:07:21 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Hi Steve, Al & Don, this is Bjorn at Brian's terminal.  I've been looking over his shoulder, and we are concerned that you might have missed the heart of the elongated region of open cells.  In my mind trying to make sure you get there would be a priority.  Any thoughts on going west?
Dec 08 15:12:55 <SteveOncley-GV>	Are you proposing going out to 130W38N?  If so, I think it is too far.  We only have another 1.5 hours to fly.  If you are suggesting something shorter, we're all ears.
Dec 08 15:13:36 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	well if you don't sample the poc at least a little bit I fail to see the point of the rest
Dec 08 15:14:47 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	so the answer is yes.. i would skip the circles and just go out there and get as much pbl data as you can in that region before going home.  looking at things closer we were confused as it seems that all your time even near the POC was spent at altitude, i.e., not descending until about 2100.
Dec 08 15:15:56 <SteveOncley-GV>	The delay was getting air traffic control permission to descend (and dropsonde diagnosing).
Dec 08 15:16:23 <SteveOncley-GV>	Are you proposing 130/38?  Don is here looking over my shoulder.
Dec 08 15:16:27 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	btw, ferrying there in the pbl is less efficient, but in my mind the best strategy, i.e., ferry to 130W 38N in the PBL then do a short sounding there to get above the pbl, then descend back in the PBL and ferry east until you get back to the boring things.
Dec 08 15:16:36 <JohnWasinger-GV>	(DaveR) - we are shutting off DU equipment -- too hot. Will restart later after it cools down.
Dec 08 15:16:44 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	yes 130/38
Dec 08 15:18:38 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	how long will it take you to get there?
Dec 08 15:19:53 <SteveOncley-GV>	The pilots are working on this calculation now.
Dec 08 15:20:19 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	good.. there is a chance that something will hang together at 130W, but you definitely need to be father west
Dec 08 15:20:40 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	sorry, i meant to say there is a chance that something will hang together as far north as 40N
Dec 08 15:22:50 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	looking at the 2200 image (i.e., current 20 minutes ago it seems that you might need to go to 131, but could stay at 40N if that is better
Dec 08 15:24:39 <JohnWasinger-GV>	Can someone call Chuck or Shanu and ask them for some guideance on the operation of the pumps.
Dec 08 15:24:46 <SteveOncley-GV>	We're currently headed to 130/38.  There is a limit to how much I want to change things on the pilots.  Would 130/38 work?
Dec 08 15:27:13 -->	dickfriesen-jeffco (rbf@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &progsci
Dec 08 15:28:03 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Actually vectoring to 131 W at your current latitutde is a better choice.  I would let the pilots tell you if that is not a good idea.  We are uploading a much better image, it should show up soon.
Dec 08 15:28:51 -->	LowellGenzlinger-ops (LowellGenz@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &progsci
Dec 08 15:29:29 <AlCooper-GV>	Hi Dick, you will be interested that the temperatures here are in quite good agreement, esp. the R sensors, and all are in agreement with AT_A. We're at low level, so T is between 0 and 10C. Earlier, at altitude, with T<-50, there was a 5C difference, with AT_A higher but all others in agreement at the lower value.
Dec 08 15:31:36 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Bjorn again... the figure is on its way.  The feature that needs to be sampled is the northsouth elongated area of open cells just west of 130.  I would give up on circles and simply cut across it in a line... if you can get there by going south, fine... let us know if you get the image and are clear on what we are thinking (I have a gaggle of undergrads waiting for me and will have to jump away soon).
Dec 08 15:33:45 <Jcowan-Jeffco>	All, please check channel &G5 for resolution on DU Rack.  Chuck is there waiting for a response.
Dec 08 15:35:19 <SteveOncley-GV>	We're asking the pilots...haven't received the 22Z image yet.
Dec 08 15:35:22 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	Hey, if the pilots want to hang out longer, I will buy dinner if they land in Santa Monica (saves fuel)
Dec 08 15:35:41 <dickfriesen-jeffco>	Alcooper- Thanks for temp update. Agreement is good. Difference from AT_A maybe mach or altitude realated or both. 
Dec 08 15:36:06 <BrianMedeiros-ucla>	ps that was still Bjorn, I will tell you when I am Brian again.
Dec 08 15:37:22 <SteveOncley-GV>	Bjorn's offer has been forwarded to the cockpit.

Dec 08 15:42:31 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	Okay, I finally changed my name, as I can be here another 10 minutes before I have to run off and teach.  
Dec 08 15:44:22 <SteveOncley-GV>	Alright, Bjorn -- 131/40 it is -- we're on our way.  Pilots estimate 1 hour on station, which is 1 circle plus some profiling.
Dec 08 15:44:35 <SteveOncley-GV>	Estimated ETA 17min.

Dec 08 15:45:14 <SteveOncley-GV>	Clouds are definitely thicker here at 39.6/130.0.
Dec 08 15:45:50 <SteveOncley-GV>	Still haven't received the 22Z photo :(
Dec 08 15:47:07 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	okay, that sounds great... looking at ION you are on a good track.    I wouldn't spend too much time on profiling, i.e., you could just due an exit sounding.  As for levels, since we have no cloud probes, I would try to be near the surface as there we will get the best signatures of drizzle cold pools if any exist.  Also consider flying along the pocs axis which is north south at 40N, extending to about 41N
Dec 08 15:47:31 <SteveOncley-GV>	We just hit a clear pocket at 39.7/130.2.
Dec 08 15:47:35 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	We just got the 2230 image.. the main axis of the poc is now at 130.3W, you.
Dec 08 15:47:50 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	That clear pocket is the start of the poc... you are more or less there... we will forward another image
Dec 08 15:49:30 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	we just uploaded the 2230 image, it is called progsci_fig.gif and should come up like the others did (or didnt)
Dec 08 15:49:32 <SteveOncley-GV>	We're passing drizzle patches.
Dec 08 15:49:41 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	hurrah!... didn't we say so?!
Dec 08 15:49:58 <SteveOncley-GV>	...yes you did...
Dec 08 15:50:16 <ChrisWebster-Jeffco>	SteveOncley-GV do you plan any more circles today?
Dec 08 15:51:03 <SteveOncley-GV>	We're probably in our last one, Chris.
Dec 08 15:51:17 <ChrisWebster-Jeffco>	I have a fix compiled up there.
Dec 08 15:51:18 <SteveOncley-GV>	...maybe one more...
Dec 08 15:51:20 -->	StuartBeaton-jeffco (beaton@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &progsci
Dec 08 15:51:24 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	okay, I have to run.. somehow I have to prepare my lecture in the next 5 minutes.   But my final word would be to consider a couple of shallow soundings, i.e., just to get the measure of the PBL depth, but then fly up and down the POC axis (going no further N than 41N)... the feature is exactly NS... and beg the pilots for more time.
Dec 08 15:51:53 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	oh yeah, an ask them what they want for dinner... I know a good sushi place.

Dec 08 16:02:13 <ChrisWebster-Jeffco>	let me give directions over on the G5 channel.

Dec 08 16:36:43 <laptop3-G5>	(DaveR-GV) The RDMA pump quit, probably from overheating. We let it cool for about an hour and then tried restart, but it does not come on. Therefore, RDMA is down until pump is fixed/changed. We have a spare at Jeffco.
Dec 08 16:37:20 <SteveOncley-GV>	Dick: these porpoises are boundary-layer sampling.  Al Schanot had suggested speed runs at altitude during the ferry.  Are you suggesting something else?
Dec 08 16:39:26 <--	SteveOncley-GV has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Dec 08 16:39:49 <dickfriesen-jeffco>	oncley- Didn't know that Al requested runs. that's good. I was suggesting a sinusoidal variation takes a couple of minutes if you have time.

Dec 08 16:43:31 <SteveOncley-G5>	Affirmative.  In-and-out of clouds.
Dec 08 16:44:29 <SteveOncley-G5>	I believe we've been doing 2000'/min.  Is that too fast for the thermodynamic sensors?
Dec 08 16:46:17 <JohnWasinger-GV>	DU Rack is back up...

Dec 08 16:52:58 <SteveOncley-G5>	Welcome back, Bjorn.  Hope your class went well.
Dec 08 16:53:48 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	Hi All, it looks like you have been having fun while I was teaching.  FYI, I brought the class (a small freshman seminar) to Brian's office, to show them why my lecture was so poorly prepared... they seemed to enjoy it.  As we walked out one of the students (a physics major) said, "that is so cool, I am definitely going to graduate school"
Dec 08 17:00:39 <--	pavel-jeffco has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Dec 08 17:00:45 <AlCooper-GV>	climbing now, heading back via waypoint used before.
Dec 08 17:08:01 <SteveOncley-G5>	Al and Dick: the pilots confirm that we did speed runs outbound at 40K' and will do another set at 45K' on return.
Dec 08 17:09:07 <AlCooper-GV>	Those who were saying this aircraft shouldn't be used for boundary layer studies should have been on this flight. It's a GREAT boundary-layer plane! Comfortable, slow enough, and even less fuel consuming than expected. Typically flying at 110 m/s or so, and control seemed easy and comfortable for the pilots. Cabin was sufficiently cool too (although we don't have much power-generating stuff in here).
Dec 08 17:10:10 <BjornStevens-UCLA>	Thats great news... in about 30 years when we are done with the RICO analysis (okay, maybe less)... it could come in handy!
Dec 08 17:12:21 <schanot_jeffco>	OK on the speed runs.  Hopefully someone is logging the times.

Dec 13 14:36:07 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Shanhu: I see you're at 20,000 ft now, so I presume it's OK to turn on your instruments and you don't need me to keep trying Chuck's phones? Please let me know if I can stop trying.

Dec 13 14:58:30 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Further info for Jeff and for the record, for interpretation of the onboard radar  (I understand he's not monitoring chat, but might like to know this): There's some echo in the vicinity you've been flying, but only at about 10 dBz on the ABQ radar. There's some 35 dBz out west from you, near Los Alamos.

Dec 19 07:09:11 <shanhu-g5>	Dave,
Dec 19 07:09:32 <shanhu-g5>	we were supposed to be in dark but see the outside -- what a depressing twilight!!
Dec 19 07:11:16 <DaveR-Jeffco>	GGW 12z is stable above 600 mb = 14kft.  Temp sounding goes isothermal -60C above 220mb = 37kft.
Dec 19 07:12:00 <shanhu-g5>	what lat is for ggw??
Dec 19 07:12:05 <DaveR-Jeffco>	And in the region 600mb to 220mb, there are easterly winds. Max wind speed 45kt at 230mb.
Dec 19 07:13:22 <DaveR-Jeffco>	GGW is Glasgow, Montana. Lat 48.20N, Lon 106.61w

Dec 19 08:28:29 -->	jwilson_ (jwilson@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &progsci
Dec 19 08:28:34 <AlCooper-G5>	Thanks, Dave, I think were back solidly in the troposphere now but were marginal for times there in Montana. The humidity wasn't as low as strat values (if I can interpret the TDL counts right) but was still very low. If you have a chance to look at the Canadian sounding at CWSE, that would be very interesting to us now.

Dec 19 08:30:24 <DaveR-Jeffco>	CN spike at 15:25 looks like you crossed aircraft exhaust trail. 
Dec 19 08:31:45 <AlCooper-G5>	I wondered what that was. The CN counts seem reasonable to me, and the difference between strat. and trop. is very interesting.
Dec 19 08:33:04 <DaveR-Jeffco>	Edmonton, Alberta, sounding has trop at 200mb = 38.4kft, -68C, winds westerly ~10kt.

Dec 20 10:56:59 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	DaveR-G5 It doesn't look too good for radar comparisons. The echoes in Texas are mostly moving east of your planned flight track (I think). Might be some targets for a comparison near the coast. Others at 33.5 N and 99W might be within your range? (Can't tell yet from here)
Dec 20 11:03:46 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	OK, I see your turn now and that takes you toward echoes with tops to 220 and  reflectivity > 40 dBz
Dec 20 11:04:43 <DaveR-G5>	Al- ok, thx for update. Over Tx panhandle see broken low level wimp-cumulus field. Further south, these are overlaid by thin sold stratus. Very smooth flt here so far.
Dec 20 11:07:48 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - the best radar targets nearby are from the Dallas-Fort Worth radar. > 40 dBz there. You're heading toward it, but I don't know if you'll need to turn and pass too far to the SW of that.

Dec 20 11:09:46 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - the radar image is almost an hour old now, so I'm hoping for an update soon. I did try to send you another update of the composite map with tops.
Dec 20 11:12:43 <DaveR-G5>	Al- I'm not sure how to access the radar images from here. Advice? 
Dec 20 11:14:30 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - You should be able to start the Firefox browser and it will default to the latest image. 
Dec 20 11:18:29 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	There is some good echo (>45 dBz) near Fort Worth. they should be about 100 mi ahead now, if they haven't changed too much in the 1/2 hr since the latest radar image.
Dec 20 11:19:53 <DaveR-G5>	Al- got it. Nifty. At 25kt, echoes will be ~LA border in 4 hours. We could consider slight east adjustment of our route to intercept.
Dec 20 11:23:05 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - I'll send you the FWS image (latest 1806). Looks good for your present track to me also.

Dec 20 11:28:15 <DaveR-G5>	pressure rake data look okay. Shows deeper BL than earlier flights when rake was further forward, as expected. 
Dec 20 11:29:22 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - if the reported tops are right, you'll be above it at FL330. 
Dec 20 11:29:35 <DaveR-G5>	(copied from &progsci channel)  pressure rake data look okay. Shows deeper BL than earlier flights when rake was further forward, as expected.
Dec 20 11:30:39 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	 -- hard to understand 50 dBz and tops only 220... I'll check IR...
Dec 20 11:32:00 <DaveR-G5>	18:30z starting 5 minutes of autopilot & autothrottle OFF; pilots hand-flying.
Dec 20 11:32:29 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	IR tops in the -40s, still below your altitude
Dec 20 11:34:17 <DaveR-G5>	Al- KFWS radar image received. We are presently ~50SE of Dallas. See extensive cirrus below us, horizon to horizon. I could send a photo, but it's not very interesting-blue above and white below.
Dec 20 11:34:49 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Still more serious echo ahead; can you get some photos of the radar display, or have you seen anything?
Dec 20 11:39:21 -->	stith (stith@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &progsci
Dec 20 11:39:23 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - sorry, I was late with that and you're well past the echoes as they appear on the latest update (18:35). You should have seen serious-looking echo, though, highest-level on the airborne radar, as you flow over Ft Worth? It would have been about 25 mi east of Ft Worth, I think.
Dec 20 11:43:49 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	At Houston, there's nothing but a few 25-dBz cells north of the city. There are also a few similar cells over the gulf that could be interesting to look at if you go that far offshore. I'll send that to you next.
Dec 20 11:45:39 <stith>	Dave, have  you been looking at wind speed over the last hour.  It appears to have dropped twice by quite a bit. 
Dec 20 11:48:15 <DaveR-G5>	Al- we were painting discrete echoes ~30 nm across, level 3 (40dbz?). Have photos of display at tilt -1 to -2.5deg.
Dec 20 11:49:04 <DaveR-G5>	The radar display also shows nav waypoints, so we should be able to get their locations accurately.
Dec 20 11:50:11 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - great, I have the nexrad images saved. Tops over Ft Worth now are up a lot.
Dec 20 11:53:43 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	 updated the Houston image to the 1846 display. 
Dec 20 11:54:23 <DaveR-G5>	Jeff- right. Speeds decreasing as we cross the trough axis, then increasing again as we get into subtropical jet. 
Dec 20 11:54:40 <DaveR-G5>	That pattern follows forecast guidance from ADDS.
Dec 20 11:56:59 <DaveR-G5>	Al- nexrad image received for KHGX. Not much going on, as you said. 
Dec 20 11:57:56 <DaveR-G5>	We are crossing ~coast now and will proceed about 5+ minutes over water before starting dropsonde tests. Just cleared to descend to FL310.
Dec 20 12:00:50 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	As a lower-echo-level test, it might be interesting to see if you see those cells ahead of you now on the radar. They're 25-30 dBZ in the latest HGX image.

Dec 20 12:12:20 <DaveR-G5>	Al- radar sees nothing yet, except for maybe skin paint off a ship? How big is range ring on Houston nexrad image?
Dec 20 12:18:54 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - I think it's 150 mi radius-- I'll try to check.
Dec 20 12:26:15 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Yes, 150 mi radius
Dec 20 12:26:54 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	(You're well past the region of those echoes now)
Dec 20 12:31:11 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	I have sent another composite, for your return planning. There are still strong echoes in the Ft Worth area and also on the Schreveport nexrad.
Dec 20 12:32:43 <DaveR-G5>	Al- we are done with dropsonde tests; four tries, four good releases & all are making data.
Dec 20 12:33:03 <DaveR-G5>	1732z- request climb FL430 on northbound return leg. 
Dec 20 12:36:07 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Great news on the dropsondes. FYI, strongest jet (>120 kt) is still at about FL400. 
Dec 20 12:42:53 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Those cells are still there SE of Houston. I estimate 150/130 nm from Houston. Reflectivity to 35-40 dBz
Dec 20 12:50:39 <DaveR-G5>	Al- we are looking. Can see coastline clearly, plus a few level-1 small echoes that may be clouds. Continue to monitor and will get photos if interesting.
Dec 20 12:52:28 <DaveR-G5>	Water CN continues to make data. Its sample flow control  is steady, although ~3% high as we climbed above ~40kft.
Dec 20 12:52:45 <DaveR-G5>	Al- KHGX radar 1941z received.
Dec 20 12:59:52 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - have sent Dallas-Fort Worth nexrad image for 1950. Still strong cells there. I don't see much at San Antonio or other nearby Texas sites.
Dec 20 13:01:10 <stith>	Dave, there are still some echoes east of DFW that are small but might be worth flying around or through the weaker parts if you and the pilots want to check out the onboard radar as a part of CHAPS
Dec 20 13:16:25 <--	dickfriesen-jeffco has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Dec 20 13:17:55 <DaveR-G5>	Al & Jeff - image received. We are seeing some echoes 150 miles out, level red; our eleven o'clock position.
Dec 20 13:18:25 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - sent 2013 FWS radar. Still strong cells there, with small area of reflectivity to 50 dBz
Dec 20 13:29:54 <DaveR-G5>	Al- image rec'd. 
Dec 20 13:30:15 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	and here comes 2024, because it changed significantly from previous
Dec 20 13:33:50 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	I see you're past the echoes (going past, or through, a small one?), so I'm going to the planning meeting for a few minutes.

Dec 20 13:58:30 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	Dave - I don't see any more radar features of interest on any of the radars in OK, KS, CO.
Dec 20 14:00:38 <DaveR-G5>	Al- okay. We show targets yellow/red at 150 miles and think they are cities, not clouds.
Dec 20 14:02:53 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	maybe Wichita?
Dec 20 14:04:31 <AlCooper-Jeffco>	(Wichita nexrad is echo-free)
Dec 20 14:05:50 <DaveR-G5>	Pressure rake continues to make data.  All 12 pitots are showing negative pressures. qcrake is about 96 mb, and pitot closest to it is about 3mb smaller.
Dec 20 14:07:20 <DaveR-G5>	Indicates BL depth is ~11 inches at location gvsf 498-R top, overhead the chem operator's seat.
Dec 20 14:52:43 <Teresa-GV>	Dave, that's an interesting result for 498-R.  
Dec 20 14:52:48 -->	ErrolFL1 (Errol@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) has joined &progsci
Dec 20 14:53:47 <Teresa-GV>	Dave, it would seem to be inconsistent with the Gulfstream data, if i remember correctly.  But then,wasn't their data for centerline?
Dec 20 15:05:10 <BillIrwin-GV>	We're about 12 minutes out or so
Dec 20 15:11:22 <DaveR-G5>	Teresa- Yes. GAC plot is for top and bottom of fuselage along centerline for "clean" aircraft. I'm not sure if it is based on modeling or measurements. Have to check.
Dec 20 15:12:13 <DaveR-G5>	Teresa- if 498R is inside BL at 11 inches, then HIMIL is too short for that location.

Dec 21 11:32:18 <teresa-gv>	dave r: I've been trying for the past hour or maybe longer to wet the wcn, but keep getting the 'out of water' indications (flashing liquid indicator, out of water message on display).
Dec 21 11:32:27 <teresa-gv>	dave: would you like me to keep priming, or is there a risk of flooding?
Dec 21 11:39:10 <DaveR-Jeffco>	Teresa- no, I think you can cease trying to get it to drink. The issue may be an air bubble within tubing inside the instrument.
Dec 21 11:39:50 <DaveR-Jeffco>	Teresa- the manufacturer would like us to fly it with the cover removed, or perhaps with a window installed so we can see what's happening.
Dec 21 11:40:50 <teresa-gv>	dave: thanks.  Sounds like a good idea if that mod will be okayed by our cert staff :-)
Dec 21 11:52:19 <teresa-gv>	we are finally close enough to see the nice wave clouds.  They are pretty high and in the area where traffic is likely to be an issue.  The pilots think it would be difficult to spring this on atc at this location at the last minute
Dec 21 11:53:30 <teresa-gv>	If we want to sample them, we would need to setup a flgiht where we can work out a location to work where the clouds are likely that gives us better access to airspace and a plan filed with atc ahead of time
Dec 21 11:54:30 <teresa-gv>	It would not be out of the question to try a second flight today, but I suspect it would compete with fixing things and it would likley bump against some crew duty issues because of that
