[GMT 09/20/05 16:50:53] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I haven't heard any word about chat/ssl beyond your e-mails.  I agree that we should not disable SSL, since reconfiguring *everybody's* clients would be a major pain, and since I don't think it's having any significant effect on bandwidth or connections.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:51:39] <MikeDaniels-G5> i will send her an email to that effect
[GMT 09/20/05 16:51:42] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Mike, is &G5 being logged?
[GMT 09/20/05 16:54:23] <GaryGranger-Boulder> has anyone looked into using an IRC peer/proxy server on the plane?  All the clients on the plane should stay connected to the proxy during dropouts, and all the traffic does not need to be echoed to the ground for every client on the plane.  After dropouts, presumably only the ground and plane peer IRC servers need to reconnect, significantly reducing the handshaking over the satellite connection.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:54:37] <MikeDaniels-G5> ChrisB, yes
[GMT 09/20/05 16:55:28] <MikeDaniels-G5> gary, thanks for the suggestion -- we should do this!!!
[GMT 09/20/05 16:55:59] <MikeDaniels-G5> i was talking to chrisW about that the other day
[GMT 09/20/05 16:56:41] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Gary, I was wondering this morning if such a thing existed.  I Googled for "multicast IRC", but didn't find anything especially useful.  Having a proxy server would definitely be nice in reducing concern about how many people participate in chat from the NRL-P3.
[GMT 09/20/05 16:58:31] <MikeDaniels-G5> i wonder if we are seeing any significant delays in transmission
[GMT 09/20/05 16:58:45] <MikeDaniels-G5> here comes a turn
[GMT 09/20/05 16:58:47] <GaryGranger-Boulder> It's not multicast, I think they're just called peer servers.  I will google too and see what I find.  It's the sort of thing that *should* exist. :)
[GMT 09/20/05 16:59:44] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Makes sense.  Presumably a peer server on the plane could be tweaked to allow only clients on the plane to connect.
[GMT 09/20/05 17:00:32] <GaryGranger-Boulder> Almost certainly.
[GMT 09/20/05 17:00:56] <MikeDaniels-G5> bumps
[GMT 09/20/05 17:01:22] <MikeDaniels-G5> want to try and see if there are latency issues?
[GMT 09/20/05 17:01:31] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> MikeDaniels-G5: If you want to test transmission delay, send some text.  I'll reply immediately when I see it with "ACK", and you can do the same.
[GMT 09/20/05 17:01:42] <MikeDaniels-G5> ok

[GMT 09/20/05 17:06:21] <MikeDaniels-G5> someone is trying to come in on the "microsoft-ds"  port (445)
[GMT 09/20/05 17:06:21] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> The GV server?
[GMT 09/20/05 17:06:29] <MikeDaniels-G5> yes
[GMT 09/20/05 17:07:33] <MikeDaniels-G5> the port is being blocked at the server but gordon is logging everything and it is showing up
[GMT 09/20/05 17:07:51] <MikeDaniels-G5> therefore, i am assuming we are *paying* for this traffic?
[GMT 09/20/05 17:08:05] <MikeDaniels-G5> maybe we need to work with inmarsat to block stuff before it's being sent
[GMT 09/20/05 17:09:04] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Is Inmarsat the ISP, or is this connection via RAS?
[GMT 09/20/05 17:09:19] <MikeDaniels-G5> we are going to try and send data down
[GMT 09/20/05 17:09:49] <MikeDaniels-G5> via inmarsat the isp
[GMT 09/20/05 17:10:19] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I would be careful about asking for firewalling then, unless we have pretty good control over open/closed ports.
[GMT 09/20/05 17:10:45] <MikeDaniels-G5> yes, good point
[GMT 09/20/05 17:13:58] <MikeDaniels-G5> i know some isps let you configure all of the filtering via a web interface
[GMT 09/20/05 17:14:31] <MikeDaniels-G5> unfortunately, this will become an issue for all three planes when the RAS goes outside
[GMT 09/20/05 17:17:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> CB, will you restart ldm on malbec for me.  I just added the GV SQL entry.  slow typing would rather have someone on the ground verify.

[GMT 09/20/05 17:19:19] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> OK, it's restarted.
[GMT 09/20/05 17:20:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> I did a pqinsert on the plane...

[GMT 09/20/05 17:22:53] <MikeDaniels-G5> but we have to use cryptocards, right?
[GMT 09/20/05 17:22:54] <ChrisWebster-GV> not using the RAS.
[GMT 09/20/05 17:23:10] <MarkBradford-Boulder> It now requires a VPN connection after RAS connection, but it's still defended from the Internet at large
[GMT 09/20/05 17:23:16] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Yes, cryptocards will be required
