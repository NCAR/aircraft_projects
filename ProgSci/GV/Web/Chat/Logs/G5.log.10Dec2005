[GMT 12/10/05 00:08:02] <LauraPan-GV> TeresaCampos-Jeffco, we are fasnated by the TDl Long right now - structure above tropopause, gravity wave?
[GMT 12/10/05 00:15:36] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> I don't have the ability to look at tdl data from the ground.  Is the wave structure reflected in other variables?
[GMT 12/10/05 00:17:16] <jeffs> We have our clearance into Jeffco now, so we will see you soon. 
[GMT 12/10/05 00:17:26] <LauraPan-GV> we have T prof structure wind speed
