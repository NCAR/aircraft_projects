Hi Ron,

The material is available from

/net/ftp/pub/temp/users/jbj/progressive/*

I suggest having the overview being the first document rererenced; then 
the two CHAPS, etc.

Thanks - Jorgen

To all Progressive Science meeting participants,

Thank you to all of you for presenting material and stimulating the 
discussion about scientific and operational issues for the upcoming 
flight series.

Ron Ruth has put together a web page with all the presentations from the 
Wednesday 14 September meeting. I have edited a few of them slightly, in 
part to amalgamate most of the CHAPS material into only two presentations.

The material is available from: 
http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/ProgressiveScience.html

All the best, Jorgen

Jorgen,

Apparently I'm not on the Progessive Science mailing list, since I could
not find your message with a recipient list.  So, here is the URL for
the documentation page I created this afternoon.  It's nothing fancy, so
you should probably take a look at it to see if it's OK before sending a
message to everyone about it.  (Is it OK to have both file sources?)

Hi Laura,

No personal laptops allowed; all heavy equipment like laptops must be bolted in and already certified by the aeronautical engineers.

I plan for Chris Webster to talk about the software for display; in the meantime look at www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/ , go down on the left side and look for aeros

If you want to exercise with one of the limited data sets from the HIAPER infrastructure flights (September), then contact Ron Ruth and I hope he can help you get the data set.

Cheers, Jorgen

Laura,

I saved a copy of the GV test flight 3 on our ftp site:  ftp.eol.ucar.edu
    file:  pub/archive/RAF-projects/GV_test/501tf03.nc

Hope this works for you.

Santiago,

I just thought I'd give you a head's up on plans for the GV's upcoming
Progressive Science missions later this month.

One plan in the works is to beam some data files to the GV during
flights.  The files most likely would be satellite images (or some
other graphical data) that won't be too large.  They would be uploaded
to EOL's anonymous ftp site probably from UCLA.  After the automatic
transfer to /scr/incoming/other, an ldm server with access to that
directory will send them via satellite to the GV.  The files will
have a specific naming convention so the LDM can identify them.

My impression is that only a few files (3-5) would occur during each
10-hour flight.  All flights will be conducted during the day, so I
don't think we need to worry about files being erased before being
passed along.

The "FTP Upload procedures" web page mentions the possiblity of a
slight delay between the time they are uplpaded and when they would be
available.  I assume that, with this small amount of traffic, there is
nothing to worry about in that regard.

Final plans for the Progressive Science missions will come after a
meeting scheduled for Thursday 17 November 2005.

Ron

Hi Ron,

thanks for letting me know. It looks to me like everything should run 
smoothly. BTW, I changed the scrubber in /scr/incoming so files have to 
be at least 1 day old before they will be deleted in the middle of the 
night. That avoids race conditions with uploads from different time zones.

Santiago,

Even though that probably won't be an issue here, it's nice to know that
I'll have at least 24 hours to retrieve the uploaded files.

I just learned today that there will be even more file transfers in real
time during this project.  There will be data coming from the GV in flight:
ASCII stream with one-second measurements; chat; and possibly updates to a
ground-based netCDF file.  I'm not sure what else.

Since a lot of these data need to be made available, the historical data
will be put on our anonymous ftp site for people to download.  I'm planning
to /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ and create a ProgressiveScience
subdirectory in it for all this.  After the project's field phase I'm
hoping that the demand will dwindle and I can archive those files off
line somewhere.  (I'm not sure they need to be put on the Mass Store.)

Again, more of these details will get solidified on the 17 November
meeting here at Jeffco.  The flights begin on Monday the 21st and will
continue for 5 weeks.

Ron

Ron,

Have you decided on a directory where the images will be placed that 
need to be sent to the aircraft during the project?

Janet

Janet,

I was thinking of using EOL's ftp site.  I have a subdirectory there
now under which we could create an "images" subdirectory:
      /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/
(I just did that now.) Would that work?

Ron

Ron,

I got this template from you!  I believe you sent it to me via email 
just before RAINEX (beginning of August).

Hi Jay,

That will be very, yes. I will ask Ron to contact you and to do a trial 
run. Chris Davis should also be involved.

Cheers, Jorgen

Hi Ron,

Can we make a web page under the RAF projects group for Progressive 
Science. The first item to add would be our combined powerpoint 
presentation, see attached. There may be other materials later, but let 
us start in a small way as soon as possible; I am already getting 
requests for information from many participants.

Many thanks, Jorgen

Jorgen, Ron,

I couldn't get the sqlion program to run as a cron job because the 
program seems to need an X window open, probably because I am using 
QSocket to send the packets to a specific port.  I don't have time to 
fix this problem, so if Ron could run the following program on bora from 
an Xwindow and leave it running all the time, it should grab the latest 
flight data from the database and be displayed in ION.  Just leave the 
Xwindow open and leave the program running indefinitely.

/code/anstett/ACtracker/sqlion.sh &

If that doesn't keep sqlion program running, then do the following:
setenv PGHOST orion.atd.ucar.edu
setenv PGUSER ads
setenv PGDATABASE real-time
/code/anstett/ACtracker/sqlion >>& /jnet/tmp/sqlion.log

Thanks,
Janet

Thanks for the password.  Can I set this up to work in iChat?  Is

TAMU, according to your rules.)

Thanks, Ken Bowman

Ron,

The libraries that it can't find are aeros software libraries for the 
new data display system.  I don't know where the system copy of those 
libraries are kept, but if you add /code/anstett/aeros/lib to your 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then the sqlion program will run.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Janet

I found a client that is at least trying to connect, but it keeps  
issuing Password Incorrect messages.  Is there a username or nickname  
that has to match that password?

Thanks, Ken

Thanks, Ron.

That seems to have done the trick.  I think I am connected if you get  
a chance to give it a try.

Jorgen,

To further complicate matters, I have a doctor appointment this afternoon.
Hopefully it won't take too long.  However, I thought I should give you
what I now have for my part of the slide presentation.  I still need to
get the chat authorization (URL or paper form).  I am not planning to
present anything regarding the on-board web service.

1)  Real-time data feed
    - Data uploaded from aircraft every 5 seconds to local data base
    - Data available for "aeros" software on UCAR computer systems only
       (inside UCAR firewall)
    - Outside access will be via web URL (ION)
       (limited measurement list; let us know if you need something special)

2)  Chat
    - We use Xchat; you may use any chat client
    - Need to sign EOL chat agreement
    - Server for EOL/RDCC:  rdcc.guest.ucar.edu/6668
    - Use SSL for all servers on this network
    - Accept invalid SSL certificate
    - Chat Channel:  &G5
    - Nickname:  FirstnameLastname-location (e.g., RonRuth-Jeffco)
                 (can use "/nick' command to change)

3)  ftp
    - Data avaliable via anonymous ftp
    - ftp download site:  ftp.atd.ucar.edu
    - directory:  /pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/
    - naming format for all files:
       PS_yyyymmdd-hhmm_<instrument>.ext
         yyyy            4-digit year
         mm              2-digit month
         dd              2-digit day
         hh              2-digit start hour (UTC)
         mm              2-digit start minute
         <instrument>    data identifier
         ext             data type extension (e.g., nc = netCDF, txt = text)
                         can have more than one ext (e.g., nc.tar)
        (omit "-hhmm" if file has no time reference)
    - Subdirectories will be created for different purposes
       data    - preliminary netCDF data from previous flights
       images  - data/image for push to GV during flights
       reports - instrument status reports and performance notes,
                 scientist notes, mission reports, etc.
    - we need data format descriptions for all files
    - we need your ftp upload plans and schedule

Does this look good to you?
(You may include my name, phone and email address on the slides.)

I spoke with Chris Davis who is reserving a FL-3 room for the
access grid and will contact Jay Alipit for reserving the equipment.
He asked about just using a conference phone, since he didn't think
people needed to see him.  (He plans to refer people to web URLs
as he does the weather briefing.)  We can talk more about this with
him directly tomorrow.

Ron

Janet & Jorgen,

I followed both sets of instructions, and got the following error message
in the sqlion.log file:
    /code/anstett/ACtracker/sqlion: error while loading shared libraries: 
libplotlib.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I submitted a help request to see if I can get the missing library put
in my path.  (I assume it's part of the ION distribution.)  Hopefully,
that is all that is needed for the program to run.

Ron

Janet,

I tried doing both of your suggestions, and each time got a missing library,
and the program died.  I have Joe Vinson searching for 3 libraries that
sqlion needs to run.  If you know where they are, please let me know.

Once we get the software running, what is the ION URL for actually viewing
the data?  The only ION URL I have is for the C-130:
      http://www.atd.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/ion/ion-p?page=c130.ion

Thanks.

Ron

Jorgen,

I have generated a simple "home" page for Progressive Science.  In it I
put a link to the powerpoint presentation.  Let me know if you think this
is OK and/or what mods you'd like me to make.

Ron

Janet,

Adding the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, a duplicate of yours,
did not change the run status of sqlion.sh.  Every time I started it up,
it deposited the following entry in /jnet/tmp/sqlion.log:
      /code/anstett/ACtracker/sqlion: error while loading shared libraries: 
libplotlib.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Some path statements in your .my_defaults file come up empty or missing
in my login environment, but it doesn't seem to me that I need any of
these:
     /usr/lib/RealPlayer8    <-- doesn't exist
     /usr/local/bin          <-- empty
     /opt/SUNWmotif/bin      <-- doesn't exist
     /fnet/linux/bin         <-- doesn't exist
     /usr/games              <-- empty
so I didn't change my environment to include them.

If you want to change your password so I can login and run the program
as you (on my Linux Enterprise 4 box, berlioz), let me know.  Also, if
you know where the libraries are actually located, perhaps there is a
way I can copy them or link to them within my own login.  If these are
aeros libraries, maybe Chris can help me.

Thanks again for sacrificing some of you PTO.

Ron

Janet,

Here's an update from Jorgen:

===========================================================
Tuesday 21 Nov schedule:

8:00 AM  Pilots briefing meeting, JeffCo conference room
9:30 AM  Take-off for 3-hour test flight, assuming aircraft
         ready
12:30 PM Touch-down
1:00 PM  Flight planning meeting in RAF conference room;
         access grid connection to FL3 ground floor.
3:00 PM  Hotline updated.
5:00 PM  Power off aircraft (approx.)

===========================================================

You'll probably get this twice, because Jorgen copied all RAF
staff on it.  (I imagine they haven't yet updated all the email
aliases).

Ron

Jorgen,

I added to the basic Progressive Science web page, but I wanted you to
see it and approve it before I made it the default page everyone sees.

The URL is:
      http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Projects/ProgSci/nindex.html

I will also add the hot-line phone number as another bullet.

Ron

Ken,

I haven't used iChat, but if it's a standard chat client, it should work.
Try it out.  The channel is active all the time.  Let me know if you need
someone else to "chat" with you.

Ken,

I figured I'd be getting some emails.  It turns out that I sent you
(and others) an incorrect password.  At the moment even the supposedly-
correct password isn't working for me, so I must either reset it or
find the correct one.  I'll be in touch.

Ron

Pavel,

I have posted a web page derived from this file.  Please check it over to
make sure that all is well.  I found a few typos and one entry which had
manufacturer and ID transposed.  Under "Special Wire" is one entry for
Termax; it looked to have two part numbers.  Also, please check the last
table, since there were some strange entries in the original file, mainly
the word "wrap" on separate lines and the word "Tunbing" which I assumed
was "Tubing."

Janet,

Here's the latest saga.  The program now gives a seg fault after a few
seconds of running.  Error messages are logged in the /jnet/tmp/sqlion.log
file, but I don't know how to interpret them.  Here's an entry from
yesterday:

sqlion started Tue Nov 22 10:34:28 MST 2005

PGUSER.

The G-V developed a fuel leak which is now serious enough for them to
ferry to Minneapolis for repair.  Looks like no flights for about a week,
so there's no rush to fix this problem.  Just thought I'd give you a look
at what may be occupying some of your time after you return.

Have a nice Thanksgiving!

Ron

Hi Laura and Ken,

The temperature probes need to be bath calibrated. When this was done 
during the last infrastructure flights, a number of differences between 
the probes were found, in particular when looking at flight data from 6 
weeks ago. Since then all the techs were working overtime on simply 
getting the prog Sci installations onboard HIAPER. Our plan is to do the 
bath calibrations on the first full maintenance day after the aircraft 
returns from Minneapolis.

In the meantime - use temperatures with great caution. I suggest using 
ATRH2 for now, but that may change after the bath calibrations.

PSXC should be OK for prelimenary analysis.

Please also keep in mind that all data are very prelimenary at present. 
progressive Science is our opportunity to characterize the sensors and 
their in-flight calibration factors. Final data from prog Sci will be 
available within 3 months of completion of the flights. Until then, 
caveat emptor.

All the best, Jorgen

Larua, Ken, et al.

In general (and in this case) one should use the "Reference" measurements.
Specifically, the ones you mentioned, PSXC (Corrected Static Pressure,
Reference) and ATX (Ambient Temperature, Reference) are appropriate.

Please be aware, however, that the data file from TF01 is preliminary,
and we are analyzing the measurements ourselves.  If revisions to the
data are made, we will post a new netCDF file with the updates and
send an email update notice.

Ron

===========================================================
Aircraft status:
 
HIAPER is now in Minneapolis for fixing the fuel leak
problem. The work is ongoing, and we have no clear indication
of when it will be finished. However, the leak has been found
where RAF's maintenance staff suspected it to be.
We expect that the repair could take several days more.
 
The hotline, 303-497-1040, will be updated on Tuesday 29
November at 3 PM. There will be no flight planning meetings
until further notice.
 
Jorgen

Hi Ron,

Sounds like you need to use ssh -Y when logging in to bora to run the sqlion program.  Also make sure that you have set the three PG* environment variables as detailed in a previous email before running the program.  I'll be flying back on Monday so I can take a look on Tuesday some time.

Janet,

Thanks for the update.  I looked at the man page, and no mention was made
of the "-Y" option.  What does it do?
At any rate, I did follow your instructions, and the deaemon is running now.

Also, the automatic script to move files from the ftp upload directory
isn't working.  I've been trying to debug it by adding print statements,
but I haven't pinpointed what's going wrong.  I do know where it is
failing, so hopefully I can get help from a perl guru to fix it.
Curiously, I thought it was just fine before you went on PTO.

Ron

Ron,

The -Y option makes the X forwarding stuff work correctly.  What is happening with the ftp upload script?  What is it not doing correctly?

====================================================================
Aircraft status:
 
HIAPER is ready to return from Minneapolis after fixing
the fuel leak.  The aircraft is expected at JeffCo at
2 PM Wednesday 30 November.
 
====================================================================
Flight planning meeting:
 
Although on short notice, we will conduct the normal flight
planning meeting today at 1 PM. Please ensure that the staff
in your group receives this message.
 
We should plan for the next flight to be Thursday 1 December,
so please contribute whatever forecast products can be ready
in time and your desires for missions.
 
====================================================================
Saturday schedule:
 
Given the short time available for progressive Science
flights, we will from now consider both maintenance and
mission flights on Saturdays. Our preference is for using
Saturdays as a maintenance day, but the two coming Saturdays
are strong candidates for flights.
 
We hope to keep Saturday 17 December as a maintenance only
day.
 
====================================================================
 
The hotline, 303-497-1040, will be updated on Wednesday 30
November at 3 PM.
 
Jorgen

Ron,

Basically, what that line of code does is check to see if the file is 
listed in the filelist.txt file.  If not, it just quits the loop, if it 
finds a match, then it will return the number where it found the match 
in the file.  Where is the program that you are running and what user 
name?  I can look at it later to see what it is doing.  Is the other 
program working that transfers progsci_ files to the plane or has that 
not been used yet?

Janet

Janet,

It simply doesn't copy the files.  I tried a test file with the correct
3-character start string.  The script recognizes it and no longer writes
the "No PS_ files found." message.  It outputs the date, but it quits
before copying the file.

One line of your code I completely don't understand:
    $where = $_, last if $filelist[$_] = $file;

After looking some more, it seems that the script isn't told about the
source directory and is trying to copy the file from "pwd."  To wit:
    system("cp -p $file /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/.");

I changed this to:
    system("cp -p /scr/incoming/other/$file 
/net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/.");

That allowed the file to copy, but it didn't update the "filelist.txt"
file.  So I guess it will be recopying it every time the cron job runs
(five-minute intervals).

Janet,

I don't know anything about the program that transfers files to the
plane.  I'm not sure who was to get that into a cron job; is that
something I was supposed to do?  I don't know where to find the code.
Please give me details, including on which machine it is to run, and
I'll try to test it out, too.  (The G-V is flying today for a 9-hour
mission.  I just asked Chris via chat whether this software was
running.)

FYI, sqlion was running since about noon yesterday.  Sometime after
5:30 p.m. it quit with a segmentation fault.  I tried restarting it
this morning and it immediately quit with a seg fault.  The log file
didn't log when it started, but one entry was added:
      row number -1 is out of range 0..-1
Hopefully we can get all these straigtened out when you get back.

If you have a way to look at the file-copy script (and if you want to),
it is:
    ~ruth/bin/ProgSci_copy
A lot of debug prints are still commented out at the moment.  What I
want, of course, is to have new files copied.  I may have commented out
the code that does that and allowed the "found" file name to be copied
again and again.  I can test that today.

Ron

Hi Ron,

I was in a class when you called (and during the briefing).  Sorry  
that I could not participate.

I will wait to hear what the plan is for tomorrow.

Ken,

There will be an update at 5:15 MST today via phone.  You can call
Allen Schanot, (303)497-1063, now for an update from our 1:00 p.m.
gathering.  Jorgen is supposed to be back here around 3:00 p.m. MST today.

If my memory serves me right, tentative takeoff time tomorrow is
11:00 a.m. MST (StratoCu with Don Lenschow) with fallback mission
takeoff around 2:00 p.m. MST.

Everyone:

Assuming the aircraft returns in good shape at 1800 tonight, we plan to 
fly a mission tomorrow.  We have two options:

1) StratoCU Mission
    Pull out & Power on 1000 MST
    Takeoff: 1200 MST
    Recovery: 2115 MST

2) New Particle Formation Mission
    Pull out & Power on 1230 MST
    Takeoff: 1430 MST
    Recovery: 2345 MST

The weather looks good for strato cu and since that is the toughest 
objective to catch this time of year it was given top priority.  
Acknowledging that conditions could change by tomorrow, the timing of 
the departure was arranged so that the entire on-station time would be 
completed just prior to sunset and so that the secondary flight could be 
conducted as originally planned without breaking crew duty limitations 
in case of bad weather.  We will update the Hotline at 1830 tonight and 
0900 tomorrow with a final decision being made at 0900 tomorrow.  The 
Science Group will meet by phone at 0900 to decide on the mission.  
There will be no flights Saturday or Sunday, but we expect to have power 
and access from 0800 to 1600 MST (or until everyone has left) for 
maintenance and instrumentation & ADS work on Saturday.   Show up early 
if you have work to do.

The next flight planning meeting will be 1400 MST on Sunday.

The projected flight manifest for Friday will be:

Henry Boynton
Bob Maxson
Gordon Maclean
2 RAF techs
Dave Rogers
Teresa Campos
Dean Lauritsen
Shanhu or alternate operator
Jorgen Jensen
Don Lenschow

Alternate: Steve Oncley

Some adjustmentsto the manifest will be made if option 2 is selsected.

Ron,

To test the upload to the plane, you just have to ftp a "progsci_" file to the ftp upload directory.  My cron job is running and should put the file into the ldm which will then transfer the image to the plane.  The web browsers on the plane have bookmarked links to display the latest image and to get a list of images.  Someone on the plane could try going to the latest image page and see if the image appears.

I'll try to look at your ftp program and let you know what I find out.  I'll also try and look at the sqlion program.  Can you run the aeros program and see if the data from today's flight is appearing in the database on the ground?

Thanks,
Janet

Ron,

I have fixed the sqlion program.  The new version is in 
/code/anstett/ACtracker/sqlion.  I think that is where you were running 
it from before, but I don't remember for sure.   The reason why it was 
not working is that a bunch of the variable names are now different from 
the 2001 flight that was in the database.  There was no current data in 
the database when I was testing my program.  You can run the program 
again and if you go to the ION plot, you should see the data from 
yesterday's flight. 

Did the images upload to the plane during flight yesterday?  I noticed 
that there were files in the ldm, but couldn't tell if the images had 
gotten to the plane.

I made a new copy of the Prog_Sci copy program.  The old one is called 
.save.  Your version with the debug stuff in it has the else paired up 
with the wrong if.  There was one bug in the program where I was doing a 
string comparison with = instead of eq.  That was why it wasn't working 
correctly.  I think that it is working fine now.  I have some test files 
in the ftp project directory that you can delete. 

Janet

Janet,

I was running sqlion from that directory, so it will be fine to run
it from there again.  Here's my procedure:
   ssh -Y bora
   setenv PGHOST orion.atd.ucar.edu
   setenv PGUSER ads
   setenv PGDATABASE real-time
   /code/anstett/ACtracker/sqlion >>& /jnet/tmp/sqlion.log &
I just started it, but I get a black screen instead of yesterday's data.
(I don't know which variables it was trying to plot.)  When I clicked
on the "Flight Track" button, it showed the end of yesterday's flight
(probably the part that starts at 00:00 UTC today).  Its title is
"Progressive Science 12-02-2005".  On the web browser screen, it says:
   Latest time recorded in real-time data file: 08:04:50 UTC
I also tried time-series plots on other variables and also got a black
screen.  Looks like it doesn't map the variables listed in the tables
to variables in the data set (my speculation).

So far as I know, no useful files got uploaded to the plane during
yesterday's flight.  Chris would be a better person to ask for details.
I know that some file with a png extension was being sent up repeatedly,
but it contained an SQL error message instead of graphics.  We also
don't know if this is run from a cron job or how often it sends this
file to the G-V.  (Details would be nice regarding the mechanism of
how and when these files are transferred.)

Thanks for fixing the copy script.  I apparently perturbed it too much
while debugging it, and, unfortunately, I didn't save an unaltered
version before mucking around.

There is another 9-hour flight planned for today departing at about
2:30 p.m. MST, so we'll be able to test things again.

Thanks for all your help!

Everyone:

The G-V took of at 1430 MST Friday Dec 2 on a New Particle Formation 
mission and is expected to recover at JeffCO around 2315 MST tonight.  
The new shroud was installed on the dropsonde exit tube and several 
sondes will be test dropped during today's mission.  All drops will be 
conducted above 30K ft where the cabin pressure differential is expected 
to add to the exit velocity of  the sonde.  There will be no flts on the 
weekend, but the aircraft will be accessable with power from 0800 - 1600 
on Saturday.  If you have something to do, come early.  If no one is on 
site they will shut down early.

Due to the need for closely spaced flights and the odd flight times, 
another New Partilce mission has been scheduled for Monday Dec 5.  See 
below for the schedule:

Monday 5 Dec
Pull out & power:   0130 MST
Take-off:                0330 MST
Recovery:               1230 MST

There will be a mission planning meeting at 1400 MST on Sunday to review 
the weather and the flight plan.  A go/no-go message will be posted on 
the Hotline immediately following the meeting - primary factors will be 
maintenance or critical instrument problems or severe local weather.  
Make sure you all re-check the message prior to departing for the 
airport Monday morning!!  We plan to fly again on Tuesday Dec 6 during 
normal working hours.  A std planning meeting will take place at 1300 
MST on Monday to review our mission options.

Allen

Hi all,

A brief list of issues to tackle after RF02:

HF radio malfunction - transmitter only.
Power supply in CHAPS rack.
DSM code different in nose, CHAPS and remainder racks
Create netcdf file; make available on prog sci web page under raf's web 
page.
CO sensor, CO2 sensor
Minor issue with time interval length of windows aeros machine
Dropsonde stuck - Dean, Mark, Steve and maybe Jack to meet on Monday morning
Sink drain still does not work at high altitudes
CN sensor smelled burnt
ION only for trackplot
Cowan DSM issue
Calibration constants for temp sensors after swap
Any other?

No early flight Monday - G'nite everybody - Jorgen

Jorgen, Ron,

I fixed the ION plot so that the variables can be displayed now.  I also 
added a change to plot the entire flight instead of just the last hour 
that it is plotting now.  I'll check on that after the next flight. 

The upload images to the aircraft procedure:  Files are ftp'ed into the 
ftp upload directory: /pub/temp/field/incoming/other.  The file names 
that are uploaded have to start with progsci_ in order for them to be 
recognized.  I have a cron job running as the ldm user on syrah, which 
will load the files into the ldm.  These files are then sent to the ldm 
on malbec and then they should be sent to the GV.  The GV receives the 
files via the ldm and then saves the files in specific directories for 
browser access.  Each of the laptops and the data system on the GV have 
bookmarks for the latest image page and a list of images.  When an image 
gets sent to the GV, the image should then display via the latest image 
page. 

I'll be back in town on Tuesday and working at FL on Wednesday.  I'll be 
back at Jeffco on Thursday.

Janet

/jnet/data/ProcSci/GV/rf02/502rf02.nc

/jnet/data/ProcSci/GV/rf02/502rf02s.nc for sample-rate.

I'll re-run tf01 & rf01 which will have new TT calibrations and the new 
dependecy for ATX (AJS, let me know if that's incorrect).

Ron, I'd like to discuss file-naming, mostly about what we will call 
concatenated ads images for archive.

Sunday 4 December, 4:30 PM
====================================================================
The plan for Monday 5 December is:

8 AM:  Continue aircraft maintenance. There are issues with
a number of sensors, with the logging of navigational data,
and with the HF radio system.
The HF radio system must be repaired prior to a flight
over water.

11:30 AM: Flight planning meeting for Monday afternoon.
Provided there is
sufficient progress on maintenance work, then we will
attempt a short 3-hour flight on Monday afternoon.

1:00 PM: Flight planning meeting for Tuesday 6 December.

The hotline, 303-497-1040, will be updated on Monday 5
December at 3 PM.

Chris,

You must have been really tired when you wrote your message.  The files
really are in the directory:   /jnet/data/ProgSci/rf02/

So far as file-naming is concerned:  by the time you concatenate the
files, you have the last recorded time, so all you need to do is append
it to the file's name.  For example:
    dsm.rf02.20051202.211923_055642.ads
I used above a date format very similar to the one I'm using for the
project production netCDF files I've already archived to the Mass Store.
For example:
    /ATD/DATA/2003/IDEAS-3/C130_N130AR/LRT/RF03.20030826.192200_210800.PNI.nc

Let me know when you have the reruns finished so I can post them to the
ProgSci ftp directory.

Ron

Monday 5 December, 2:45 PM
====================================================================
 
The plan for Monday 5 December is:
There will be no flights today, Monday. Strong winds
means that we will not attempt a flight.
 
The plan for Tuesday 6 December is:
 
Continue aircraft maintenance. The aircraft HF radio
will be repaired; a fault has been found in a fibre-optical
cable and this will be replaced. Later
in the afternoon we will roll the aircraft out, and test
the HF system on the ramp.
The HF radio system must be repaired prior to a flight
over water.
Other maintenance issues relate to temperature calibrations
and trace gas measurements.
 
At 1:00 PM we will do a flight planning meeting for a
mision on Wednesday 7 December.
 
After the 1 PM meeting we will conduct a safety briefing.
If you have a need to fly on HIAPER during Progressive
Science, then you should plan to attend this safety briefing.
Please inform your colleagues about this safety briefing.
 
The hotline, 303-497-1040, will be updated on Tuesday 6
December at 3 PM.

It is currently 3:30 PM on Tuesday 6 December.
====================================================================
The plan for Wednesday 7 December is:
 
In case the snow has stopped:
5:00 AM:  A snowplow will clear the ramp
6:00 AM:  Aircraft out, re-fuel, power on
8:00 AM:  Take-off for a 9-hour START mission of a cut-off low
pressure system over the high plains.
5:00 PM:  Touch-down
 
In case of continued snow in the morning, we will delay the
take-off until 10 AM and still have a 9-hour flight.
 
If we have to delay past 10:00 AM take-off, then we will
shorten the flight and have a latest touch-down of 7 PM.
 
Tentative plans for Thursday 8 December calls for either a
marine stratocumulus flight or for a new Particle Formation
flight to arctic Canada.
 
The next flight planning meeting will be Wednesday at 1 PM.
 
The hotline, 303-497-1040, will be updated on Wednesday 7
December at 3 PM.

It is currently 3:30 PM on Wednesday 7 December:
 
 
The plan for Thursday 8 December is:
 
7:00 AM:  Power on
8:00 AM:  Aircraft out, re-fuel and power on
9:00 AM:  Decision on either a marine stratocumulus flight
          over the Pacific (DOCIMS) or a New Particle flight due north
          to 75-80 degrees north with tropopause penetrations.
10:00 AM: Take-off (in either case)
7:00 PM:  Touchdown
 
The plan for Friday 9 December (tentative only at present):
If marine stratocumulus is an option, then take-off time will
be 10 AM, regardless of objective. Touchdown at 7 PM.
 
The plan for Saturday 10 December (tentative only at present):
Maintenance day:  Access 8 AM to 4 PM.
Several A/D calibrations with access to main
power distribution rack DSM will mean occasional no research
power on aircraft. This may be for several periods of half to one hour.
The datalogger work will take priority over other work.
 
The next flight planning meeting will be Thursday at 1 PM.
 
The hotline, 303-497-1040, will be updated on Thursday 8
December at 3 PM.

Dave,

Perhaps I can create a subdirectory with the larger files.  Once that
directory gets populated, I plan to add a README file to describe the
contents.  The thumbnail gallery would still be nice to have.

Hi Vanda,

Firstly, we will have an early flight Monday Morning; 3 AM take-off for 
a 8-9 hour flight. They should be on the ground at about 11 AM.

(1.i)  My suggestion is that we start the T-REX at 12:00 Noon in order 
for the Wyoming pilots to have a chance to drive home reasonably early. 
This will require running two meetings at JeffCo with a time overlap:

T-REX meeting start at 12:00, end when finished; conference room. 
Suggested participants Stith, Cooper, Jensen, Baeuerle, Dirks, Moore, 
UWyo pilots, RAF pilot/s, Hocke and Lauritsen? I dont know if all are 
needed, or if others from EOL should be present. Outside staff - you decide.

ProgSci meeting in the library, 1:00 PM. RAF project manager will be Al 
Schanot; RAF pilots will participate for the flight planning as needed, 
probably mainly after the decision about what mission to fly has been 
made. We will take care of allocating pilots to the two meetings.

(1. ii) Conference phone - OK, but does that mean that they would not be 
on access grid? And is that OK?

(1. iii) We have an access node at the JeffCo conference room. We will 
need to try the system prior to Monday. Please send the contact details 
to Ron Ruth tomorrow morning (ruth@ucar.edu); better for Friday than Monday.

(2) Sunday is our hard down day. Monday's mission is already decided, we 
will work on seat availability on Tuesday and onwards. We need to do 
safety briefings - 75-minute duration. Preferably we would do that on 
Monday morning; will you all be here? What time? We prefer not to do the 
briefings in 'drips-and-draps'.

We may need to have a maintenance day while you are here; it is too 
early to decide on the schedule.

(3) Dropsonde is a work in progress. We have video filmed the release, 
and they did a release test again today. I do not know the state at 
present. Each day we work on one or more aspects.

Cheers, Jorgen

I thought you would be interested in this message that I just 
received from Bjorn Stevens this morning.  I would say that HIAPER 
progressive science is going very well, including the education 
component.

Everyone is doing a great job and it is paying off.  Congratulations!

Roger

Hi all,

If you have a need to fly on HIAPER during Progressive Science, then 
please plan to attend a safety briefing on the afternoon of Tuesday 6 
December. This safety briefing will start immediately after the end of 
the 1 PM flight planning meeting.

The schedule of the safety briefing is in general inflexible; we need to 
do it on a non-flight day, and there is a need to fly as many days as 
possible between now and 23 December.


If you plan to attend, then please send a message to me.

Thanks, Jorgen

Progrssive Science Update

The scheduled maintenance for today was successfully completed and the 
DU instrument was installed and tested.  While we still have some issues 
with the RAF temperature sensors,  all instrumentation is ready for a 
flight.  Note that the removal of the dropsonde, the installation of the 
RAF CN/RDMA system and installation of the DU instrument have all been 
inspected and signed off. 


The plan for Monday 12 December is:

1:00 AM:  Aircraft out, re-fuel and power on
3:00 AM:  Take-off  for a 9 hour (max) new particle formation
         mission past san Diego and south to 18 degrees.
12:00 Noon: Touchdown

There will be a 2:00 PM planning meeting tomorrow in the JeffCo 
conference room to fine tune the flight track.  Contact for tropopause 
height forecast and brief weather watch will be done by phone.  The 
conference room number is 407-5311.

There will be the standard 1:00 PM meeting on Monday Dec 12 to make 
plans for a Tuesday mission.  Expect no further updates prior to the 
start of pre-flight activities on Monday.

We successfully completed a new particle mission early this morning.  
During the flight some new problems were encounterd in the research 
temperature systems.  We are working on that today and believe we can 
have things ready to fly later tomorrow.  So we have tenatively planned 
a CHAPs mission, Tuesday December 13th.

Pull out:       1100 MST
Takeoff:       1300 MST
Recovery:    1900-2000 MST

If the problems with the temperatures cannot be resolved in time, 
Tuesday will be converted into a maintenance day and we would hopefully 
fly Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.  We will update the Hotline at 5:30 
PM tonight and 10:00 AM Tuesday to adjust the timetable as necessary.

We discussed long terms plans for the week.  Assuming that the current 
plan for Tuesday holds and the temperature data look good, the following 
projected schedule will apply.  Note that there will be a standard 
1:00PM planning meeting every day to monitor weather conditions and 
possibley alter the science mission on 24 hour notice.


Wednesday:   START mission.  0800 TO for 9 hours.

Thursday:   Maintenance - no flight

Friday: Combined CHAP & New Particle mission including c-130 
intercomparison. Takeoff - TBD.

Saturday:   Maintenance - no flight

Sunday:  Hard Down day

Monday: New Particle mission.  0300 TO for 8-9 hours

Please check the Hotline for updates.

 Research flight rf07 is just wrapping up with no major problems.  The 
plan for Wednesday 14 December is as follows:

START research mission planned.

Pull out:       0600 MST
Take-off:     0800 MST
Recovery:    1700 MST

Thursday December 15th will be a no-flight maintenance day with power 
and access during normal working hours.  This being the case there will 
be no planning meeting on Wednesday.  The NOAA ozone sensor will be 
removed following the tomorrow's flight.  A planning meeting at 1:00 PM 
Thusday will be needed to setup Friday's mission

Friday will be the G-V/C-130 intercomparison with added G-V objectives 
as determined in Thursday's meeting.  We expect the intercomparison 
segment to last up to 3 hours so long distance objectives are doubtful.

Check the hotline for anything that could impact the Wednesday flight.

 The START flight conducted today was successful, but cut short due to 
very strong convection in a portion of the target area.  The NOAA ozone 
sensor will be removed tonight and will be off the aircraft until 
sometime next week.

Thursday 15 December will be a maintenance day. 

    Activities:
        The pressure rake and "moving" HIML inlet will be repositioned 
to new aperture plates.
        Continuing work on research temperature systems
        Continuing work on dropsonde system @ FL1
        Planning meeting at 1300 MST

Friday 16 December will be a flight day with the primary focus being the 
intercomparison between the G-5 and the C-130.  Timing on Friday's 
activities will be determined at Thursday's planning meeting.

Staturday 17 December will be a maintenance day.  Activities TBD.

As always, check the hotline for updates.

Dropsonde Dispenser Status:
Jack Sauer of Aeromet arrived at 0745 this morning and after a short 
briefing on our proposed modifications, David Allen started performing 
the necessary modifications.  This work should take several hours to 
perform including reassembly of the device.

> Work on the analog cards, temperature measurements and the dropsonde 
> dispenser continued throughout the day.  The plan for tomorrow, 
> December 16th,  is to fly a CHAPS/Friehe mission with a G-V / C-130 
> intercomparison flight.  In addition, several low passes will be made 
> at the Ft. Morgan airport.  Details follow:


G-V:
          Pullout:   0600 MST
          Takeoff:   0800 MST
          Low Passes at Ft. Morgan: 0820 - 0840 MST
          Return:   1400 MST

C-130:
          Pullout:   0800 MST - after G-V has taxied from ramp
          Takeoff:   0900 MST
          Return:   1200 MST

There will be no planning meeting on Friday December 16 but the regular 
2:00 PM meeting will take place on Sunday December 18th.  AT that time 
the final timeline and flight planning will be determined for Monday's 
New Particle mission.  Departure will be pre-dawn, but the exact time 
will depend on whether the northern or southern transect is selected.

Staurday will be a standard maintenance day with access from 0800 to 
1600 MST.  We hope to reinstall the dropsonde at that time.  If Friday's 
Friehe mission is successful, we will also move the pressure rake to a 
new location.

The hotline will be updated on Friday after the research flight and 
again on Sunday after the planning meeting.

 Friday's missions both went well with the intercomparison being 
successful and no new squawks.  Plan for Saturady Dec 17 is a 
maintenance day with access and power from 0800 to 1600 MST.  Key tasks 
are the movement of the "rake",  re-calibration of the temperature 
sensors and pre-flt prep of  the DU analyzer.  The dropsonde has been 
modified and is being re-installed this afternoon.  We are still 
planning an early morning New Particle mission for monday Dec 19, but 
the direction and times have not yet been finalized.  We will have firm 
numbers by 1600 Saturday.  CHeck the Hotline and e-mail for details 
after that time.  We will hold a std planning meeting at 1400 MST Sunday 
to check the weather and discuss possible options for the rest of the 
week.  The Hotline will be updated again following that meeting.  Our 
highest priorities will be the testing of the dropsonde system and the 
analog signal recording - so a specific plan like we laid out for last 
week will not be possible.  We do intend to do a dropsonde test during 
the Monday mission!!

We need SE coverage for Monday's flt and for the ongoing troubleshooting 
of the A/D boards.  I need Chris, Gordon and John to work out who will 
cover the flight.  Departure time will be either 0300 or 0500 MST with 
an expected duration of 9 hours.  Let me know by the end of the Sunday 
planning meeting.

We will also need a local snow forcast for Monday night-morning.  Any 
potential for ice accummulation during the warmup period would delay or 
cancel the flight.

Ron-
Good idea. Do you want the full size (1600x1200) images instead of 
800x600 that are on my website?

Ron-
Okay, full size images are in /h/9/dcrogers/ProgSci/Flights/rf02/photos/
Time stamp on photos is UTC.

I also have photos from rf01, but haven't made a web-gallery page with them.

  ..Dave..

Hi Ron,

I am working on running back trajectories for the Progressive Science  
flights.

I've been looking through the flight data files and noticed a few  
metadata errors.  The GGLAT variable says "GPS East longitude" ,  
while GGLON says "GPS North latitude".  If I notice anything else  
I'll let you know.

Ken


         float GGLAT(Time) ;
                 GGLAT:_FillValue = -32767.f ;
                 GGLAT:units = "deg" ;
                 GGLAT:long_name = "GPS East longitude" ;
                 GGLAT:valid_range = -90.f, 90.f ;
                 GGLAT:Category = "Position" ;
                 GGLAT:standard_name = "latitude" ;
                 GGLAT:missing_value = -32767.f ;
                 GGLAT:SampledRate = 1 ;
                 GGLAT:DataQuality = "Preliminary" ;
         float GGLON(Time) ;
                 GGLON:_FillValue = -32767.f ;
                 GGLON:units = "deg" ;
                 GGLON:long_name = "GPS North latitude" ;
                 GGLON:valid_range = -180.f, 180.f ;
                 GGLON:Category = "Position" ;
                 GGLON:standard_name = "longitude" ;
                 GGLON:missing_value = -32767.f ;
                 GGLON:SampledRate = 1 ;
                 GGLON:DataQuality = "Preliminary" ;

Maintenance scheduled for 12/17/2005 was mostly completed as planned. The DU 
analyzer appears operational. Calibrations of temperature sensors were not 
successful because of continuing high signal noise. This issue is high 
priority and is being addressed in parallel with research flights. Moving of 
the pressure rake and related re-routing in the cabin were completed as 
planned.

Northbound new particle formation flight is planned for Monday, 19/12/2005. 
Takeoff is planned at 5 am MST, aircraft access at 3 am, rollout at 3:30 am. 
This plan is subject to change based on the outcome of the Sunday planning 
meeting (2 pm MST 12/18/2005), and also weather conditions and forecast. Any 
potential for ice accumulation during the warm-up period would delay or 
cancel the flight.

Check Progressive Science hotline x1040 to verify that the outlined flight 
is not changed or cancelled. Hotline will be updated on Sunday after the 
planning meeting.

 Today's flight went well, but there are still some problems with the 
dropsonde system.  All 4 drops were successful, data wise, but there 
were serveral "scuffs" on the fuselage noted in the post flight 
inspection.  The rake and moveable HIML inlet were repositioned 
following the flight and the NOAA ozone analyzer was re-installed.  The 
plan for Wednesday 21 December is as follows:

We will conduct a combined START / CHAPS mission with additional 
dropsonde testing.

Pull Out:   0600 MST
Takeoff:    0800 MST
Duration:   8-9 hours

Dean Lauritsen will take the flight as the dropsonde operator.

We will hold the standard 1:00 PM planning meeting to discussion options 
for Thursday.  Additional dropsonde testing could be required on this 
flight.

As always, check the Hotline for any last minute updates.

Jim,

Let me know if you need help getting connected.  The plane is flying
now.  The chat is up and running 24/7, but there may not be much discussion
when the no flight is in progress.  The Progressive Science home page (with
chat information) is:

Mike,

Jim "signed" his chat request yesterday, so I sent him the password.
He replied this morning that he got it, so I just sent him a message
back asking him to contact me if he needs help getting connected.

A few weeks ago I  lft him a voice mail regarding chat and the instructions
on the Progressive Science web site, so hopefully he'll be up and running.

Ron

 Todays flight was cut short due to problems with the NOAA ozone 
analyzer and the RAF rake.  Both have been repaired and will be ready 
for a flight on Thursday.  We were also able to conduct some dropsonde 
tests from 40K ft.  All were successful and a post flight inspection 
indicated there was no contact with the aircraft fuselage.

Plan for Thursday December 22 is as follows:

First option - Strato-cumulus mission off west coast / with dropsondes

Second option - combined START / CHAPS mission with possible mountain 
wave penetrations

Pullout:     0730 MST
Takeoff:   0930 MST

If option 1 plan for 9 hour duration / decision update by 0800 MST / 
final decision by 0900 MST

If option 2 plan for 6-7 hour duration and a likely delay in takeoff to 
1100 MST

We will hold a standard planning meeting at 1300 MST Thursday.

 It is 1000 AM Thursday Dec 22nd.  The G-5 just departed on the last of 
the Progressive Science flights - rf13 being the fourth flight this 
week.  This is a DOCIMS mission to the west coast with some CHAPS 
objectives added in.  We hope to conduct some wave cloud penetrations 
here on the front range during the return leg - if time permits.  If 
everything goes as expected the aircraft will be returning to JeffCO at 
around 1830 MST.  There will only be limited access to the aircraft post 
flight tonight.  Those needing to remove equipment should show up on 
Friday morning.  Access and support will be provided from 0800 to 1200.

The 1300 MST PLanning Meeting for today has been cancelled. 

Contact Al Schanot with any questions (303-497-1063 / schanot@ucar.edu).

Steve,

I'm not sure when it will be available, but if it shows up today, I'll
let you know.

Steve,

We encountered a problem reading the raw ADS file's header, so the
nimbus processor cannot access the file.  Allen Schanot said that
we'll have to await Chris Webster's return to "fix" the file before
we can produce a netCDF file.

Steve,

In case you didn't discover this yourself, the RF13 netCDF data file is
now available from the ProgSci ftp directory.

Ron, of course, installed and configured the server, so yes, he knows a 
great deal about them -- but since the server seems to be working just 
fine, the most likely problem is the configuration of the client.  I've 
sent Jim e-mail, including my cell number, but haven't heard back from 
him yet.

Everyone:

Following all of the meetings today, we have come up with the following 
plan for G-5 activities in January and through the T-REX upload.  There 
will be no flights this week, but we expect to fly 2-3 times starting on 
Tuesday Jan 10th and ending by Jan 18th.  The first flight on Tuesday 
will be conducted during normal working hours, but will be 6-7 hours in 
duration in order to test the dropsondes over water and to conduct a 
dropsone/G-5 intercomparison of state parameters.  Additional gust probe 
and CO2 contamination maneuvers will be included during the transit 
legs.  The T-REX upload will start on Jan 18th - remember that ATLAS 
will be in town working on the SATCOM system the week of Jan 23rd!

Action Items:

1) The Trailing Cone installation and flight testing has been defered 
until after T-REX.

2) We will swap out the radome gust probe with the new unit we just got 
back from ST Gobain.  We will conduct T-REX flight operations with the 
existing gust probe tubing.  After T-REX we will replace the tubing with 
larger diameter tubing.

3) We will remove the "rake", but leave the internal rack alone until 
the time of the T-REX upload.

4) We will design and fabricate an external extension to the dropsonde 
tube.  Drag specifications will be determined by the T-REX payload 
specified below.  Installation to be complete prior to the start of test 
flts on Jan 10th.

5) We will conduct calibrations of the 4 temperature sensors using the 
decade reference (techs).

6) We will conduct calibrations of the 2 dewpoint sensors using the 
Cryogenic Calibrator (PM's).

7) ADS-3 and A2D work to continue.




Review of T-REX Payload/Tasks:

a) Nose Mensor pressure sensors:  Replace as new units available.  
Minimal impact.  Not likely prior to T-REX.

b) Change 1 HARCO temperature sensor out for an un-heated Rosemont 102.  
Some re-wiring needed.  Make swap during T-REX upload.

c) TDL to be flown "as is".

d) VCSEL hygrometer flight testing has been defered until after T-REX.

e) HIMIL inlet for ACD ozone and RAF CO as planned.  DU rack top stand 
available for use.

f) Aerosol HIMIL inlet for CN and RDMA as planned.

g) Dropsonde antenna "as is".

h) External digital camera mount defered until after T-REX.  Investigate 
addition of side view cabin mounted camera.

i) CAPS probe integration defered until after T-REX.

j) King probe LWC unit and spare elements being purchased.  Delivery by 
2/1/06.  Plan to mount on std belly aperture plate in time for T-REX 
flight operations.  Relocated post T-REX.

k) Goodrich Icing rate indicator being purchased.  Delivery date 
uncertain.  Status for T-REX is TBD.  If available for T-REX, will mount 
on std aperture plate.  Relocated post T-REX.

l) T-REX cabin layout to reflect these changes.  Summary to follow under 
a separate email.

m) ADS-3 control & display management to be standardized so that a 
software engineer is not required for pre-flight setup or onboard 
operation. Pre-T-REX.

Everyone:

We plan to fly the G-5 Tuesday January 10th in order to continue with 
our testing of the dropsonde system.  Schedule for activities is:

Pull out: 0730
Takeoff: 0900
Duration 7 hours

We expect to conduct a total of 6 drops, 4 from 35K ft and 2 from 42K 
ft.  The aircraft will ferry out at the first release height.  We have 
planned for 10 minutes between drops for the lower drops, all to be 
conducted in the same rough geogrphical area out over the Gulf of 
Mexico.  The final two drops will be made as close together in time as 
possible.  Following the releases from 42K ft, the aircraftt will 
profile down in the vicinity - as rapidly as ATC allows - down to 150 ft 
AGL in order to get a sonde to aircraft intercomparison.  We will then 
climb up to 1000 ft AGL and conduct a set of Lenschow maneuvers - sans 
reverse heading.  The return ferry will be conducted at 45K ft.  During 
the transit legs, aircraft bounday layer contamination speed runs will 
be conducted.

Be advised that there is a stong wind forecast for Tuesday.  We will 
look at the weather just prior to pull out to see if we need to postpone 
the mission to the following day.

If any questions, call Al Schanot (1063)

Everyone:

We are planning to fly Thursday January 12th to wrap up our pre-TREX 
flight testing, weather permitting.  Here is the plan for tomorrow:

    Flight Planning: 0900
    Pull Out:   1130
    Takeoff:   1300
    Duration: 2-3 hours

We have no dropsonde objectives on this flight since the tests from 
Tuesday's mission were successful - both data and release wise.  We will 
set up a differential GPS base station and suface site (temp, RH, 
pressure) at Fort MOrgan airport to provide data for another series of 
low passes at that location.  We also plan to conduct some maneuvers at 
several altitudes.  Those are the base objectives.  If someone has some 
additional tasks they should contact me with the details this 
afternoon.  We will examine local weather conditions first thing in the 
morning to determine our flight status.

Allen

I suggest we meet next Tuesday, 10 January, 9:00-10:30, in the Jeffco
conference room to review the status of measurements on the G-V. I have
in mind a short discussion and review of what we know about each
measurement (as well as data-handling issues) and some coordination of
approaches to continued study, improvement, and characterization of
these measurements. If you are in the "To" list, please let me know if
you can't participate at this time. (Of course, I'd welcome anyone else
who is interested in this topic also, so please help me invite any other
interested people I may have overlooked.)

Dear Progressive Science participants,
 
Allen Schanot has produced a new data set for the Progressive
Science missions. This new data set is still PRELIMINARY; as
RAF continues work on more in-depth analysis of instrument
performance, we will produce a final data set at some future
date, probably some months from now.
 
The current preliminary data set supersedes the date you may
have downloaded shortly after the flights. We recommend that
you immediately switch your analysis to the new preliminary data
set (hereafter called the January 2006 preliminary data set).
 
For almost all variables, it is recommended that you use the
so-called reference values: ATX for temperature, DPXC for
cooled mirror dewpoint temperature, etc. for the variables
ending in X.
 
Of special note is the use of ATX; a test with dropsondes and
spiral aircraft descent showed the AT_A temperature to be
best. The AT_A temperature is identical to ATX, and we
recommend use of ATX in your analysis. ATX has also been used
for the temperature variable in all calculations involving
derived parameters, such as true airspeed, etc.
 
Ron Ruth has made the data is available by anonymous ftp from:
  ftp://ftp.eol.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/
 
Finally a warm thanks to everybody helping in collecting and
other work on the progresive science data, and a special thanks
to Allen Schanot for producing this data
set. It is in our opinion 'pretty good' (as in close to final),
but as detailed in the more technical notes below, there is still
work to be done on providing a final data set to you all.
 
Happy analysis - Jorgen
 
==================================================================
Allen Schanot technical notes:
 
Everyone:
 
I have produced a consistant set of Progrssive Science data
files on /jnet/data in the following format: 502rfxx.nc.  I
made no attempt to edit out bad data so a release to the P.S.
Users should be accompanied by recommendations on which
variables to use.
 
These files include the following adjustments - most are
apparent through a review of the "header"
 
Temperatures
   Gnd base resistance cals for RAF research temperatures
   (rf01-rf05) and (rf06-rf15) to match card swap
   Despiking of RAF research temperatures was turned on (per
   cjw recommendation)
   Recovery factor of 1.0 for all RAF research AT's
   Did NOT use the RAF "zee factor" correction to total
   temperature
   ATX & TTX were set to the avionics values (XXX_A) - based
   on the dropsone intercomparison!
 
Time lags on key variables
   (-1000 ms) on all aviaonics variables (XXX_A)
   (-1000 ms) on avionics GPS gnd speeds (VEW_G, VNS_G)
   (various) on IRS attitude variables
   Garmin based variables (GGXXX) have not had a time lag
   applied yet - it is greater than 1 second.
 
Offsets in THDG and PITCH appear in the header as calibration
coefficients.
 
Use the digital version of the dew pointers for the DPLC &
DPRC calculations
 
Latest (but still need work) PCOR's and Sensitivity

Everyone:

I have produced a consistant set of Progrssive Science data files on 
/jnet/data in the following format: 502rfxx.nc.  I made no attempt to 
edit out bad data so a release to the P.S. Users should be accompanied 
by recommendations on which variables to use.

These files include the following adjustments - most are apparent 
through a review of the "header"

Temperatures
    Gnd base resistance cals for RAF research temperatures (rf01-rf05) 
and (rf06-rf15) to match card swap
    Despiking of RAF research temperatures was turned on (per cjw 
recommendation)
    Recovery factor of 1.0 for all RAF research AT's
    Did NOT use the RAF "zee factor" correction to total temperature
    ATX & TTX were set to the avionics values (XXX_A) - based on the 
dropsone intercomparison!

Time lags on key variables
    (-1000 ms) on all aviaonics variables (XXX_A)
    (-1000 ms) on avionics GPS gnd speeds (VEW_G, VNS_G)
    (various) on IRS attitude variables
    Garmin based variables (GGXXX) have not had a time lag applied yet - 
it is greater than 1 second.

Offsets in THDG and PITCH appear in the header as calibration coefficients.

Use the digital version of the dew pointers for the DPLC & DPRC calculations

Latest (but still need work) PCOR's and Sensitivity parameterizations - 
see Chris for code

Wind calculations use avionics GPS ground speeds and the  inertial 
attitude variables from IRS_1 for input.

All-

I extracted 50Hz data from the pressure rake, using a data_dump command 
that Gordon provided. The files are ascii text, about 2Gb total:

I scanned briefly through the data but have not done a quality-assurance 
assessment or summary (except to document where the rake was on 
different flights and when maneuvers were done). Rake data for rf12 are 
no good (piping was hooked up wrong).

Do you want to fold these data into the project archive now, or wait 
until after some q/a evaluation?  Carl Friehe is interested in them, 
tho' I don't know exactly what he plans for analysis.  Note that the 
1-Hz rake data are already in the netcdf files (variable name PRAKE12).

Dave,

I certainly want to archive them.  Since these are in ASCII, they are
incompatible with the netCDF data.  Are there any plans to convert them?
I am also missing some metadata, e.g., descriptions for each channel.
Will these be available, so they can be added as attributes to a netCDF
file, assuming we do the conversion?  If not, can one create a README file
with more information that can accompany the archived ASCII files.

I have no qualms about archiving the data in their present format.  If
you are planning to produce a "corrected" set of these measurements based
on your QA, I'll archive them in addition to the the present ones.

Ron

Ron-

imho, we probably don't need to archive in the present form because it's 
easy to extract PRAKE12 from the ads file.

In terms of prep for release, I suggest:
0. (Dave) write the README file.
1. (Dave or Ron) Notify Carl Friehe and put these files on ftp as for 
his use, with notice of their "preliminary" status.
2. (Dave) review the 50Hz data to identify what's clearly bad and trim 
it off.
3. (Dave) write documentation and variable name descriptions
4. (Ron) archive the cleaned-up files as compressed ascii

There will be subsequent processing, for example, to generate 1-Hz 
values of PRAKE12 as an array in the netcdf file, to convert these 
differential pressures to velocities, assess if any time shifting is 
needed, etc.

In the meantime, I can move these files to hard disk on atd.flow which 
has empty 60Gb in /data

ok?

   ..Dave..

Sounds good. I'll make the readme file and ping you when it's ready.
Thanks.

Hi back to you, Jorgen,

I removed TF01 from the ftp site and revised the README file.  (I still
would like to add Allen's comments to that file, if it's OK with you
and him.)

Dave,

Your task list looks fine to me.  I agree that since the data are in the
raw ADS file (not indicated as such in your first message), they don't
need to be archived separately.  I can post the files, using the list you
gave me, on the EOL ftp site for Carl Friehe to pick up.  In your README.txt
file, perhaps you can add a statement warning him of the preliminary
status.  I'll add that file to the directory.

I can notify Carl, repeating the warning, once I have the files in place.

OK?

Ron

As part of the Progressive Science project, a pressure rake was
fabricated and used to measure the profile of dynamic pressure within
30 cm of the aircraft skin at several aperture pad locations. There are
six aperture pads on HIAPER, where air sample inlets and other equipment
can be mounted. The pressure rake measurements provide estimates of air
speed at the location of air sample inlets.

The rake has twelve small pitot tubes along its strut and a large
pitot-static tube at the end. All pitot tubes share the same reference
pressure, i.e., the total pressure of the large pitot-static tube. The
large pitot-static tube has static pressure ports on its side. The twelve
pitot tubes connect by small tubing to a NetScanner (Pressure Systems,
Inc.) that is located at the foot of the rake, inside the aircraft. The
NetScanner measures the twelve differential pressures at 50 samples per
second, and sends data to the aircraft data system.  Dynamic and static
pressures of the large pitot-static tube are measured with other sensors
and recorded separately.

The pressure rake was moved between flights.

The data are in line-feed terminated ASCII columns: 
year, month, day, hh:mm:ss.xxx, ##, #bytes, and twelve differential
pressures (mb). The order of differential pressures is 0 to 11, where
#0 is the small tube nearest the aircraft skin. Distance from the skin
is given in the following table.  The pressures are referenced to the
total pressure of the large pitot-static tube. For example, if the value
is -37 and the total pressure of the large pitot-static tube is 100,
then the actual total pressure is 63 mb.

Dave,

I have transferred all the files to the ftp directory
    ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/rake/
and used gzip to compress them to about 1/5 the original size.  I also
created a "readme" file that lists uncompressed and compressed file sizes.
I plan to include that information in the README file that you are preparing.

Finally, just for my clarification, I assume your 50Hz really is 50 sps,
not 100 sps (50Hz Nyquist).

Dave,

Thanks.  I added data file size info to the bottom of your file.
Hope you don't mind.

I'll write Carl and let him know all the details.

Ron

Carl,

Dave Rogers has made available the preliminary data for the pressure rake
flown on our Gulfstream-V N677F during the Progressive Science project.
The data files themselves have been compressed using gzip.

The files and a plain-text README-prake12.txt file with lots of information
awaits you at the URL:
      ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/rake/

Let Dave or me know when you have downloaded them and if you have any
troubles.  (Hopefully you can handle gzipped files.)

Ron

It will be a while before I download these files.  I am going to a
meeting all next week.  Plus, I have to get them into Matlab.

Thanks for the notice.

/jnet/data/ProgSci/Jan20 has the ads files and the netCDF files.  I

Ron-

Carl Friehe is asking how to get Progressive Science flight data to 
supplement the rake measurements. I am pointing him to the 1-Hz netcdf 
files at ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/

but he may want to get sample-rate data. I snooped around /jnet/data/ 
and couldn't find, although I remember they were produced at one time. 
Can you advise on how to get them, assuming Carl wants them?

Thanks.

   ..Dave..

Ron-

I'm not sure yet what CarlF wants. He has a new MS student just starting 
to look at the 50Hz rake data, so I am assuming he wants the other stuff 
at same rate (pressures, temperatures, etc.).

Let's just wait and see what he wants. If he wants faster stuff, then we 
can look further.

Thanks.

   ..Dave..

Dave,

I personally don't remember sample-rate netCDF files from Progressive
Science.  Perhaps Jorgen can help.  If they did exist, there is a remote
chance that they were scrubbed from /jnet/data or perhaps may have been
put in an other-than-normal directory.

I'm sure that Chris can recreate them, if needed.  (I presume you want
sample-rate and not our standard "high-rate" data.)

Hi Ron and Dick:

We are able to load the GV data into Matlab now.  I thought we would
look at static pressure from the GV and NCAR ports.  Per an old email
from Dave Rogers, I went to 

ftp://ftp.atd.ucar.edu/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/

but could not access the "log" directory.  I was looking for log notes
indicating what flights might have speed runs etc.

Please advise.

Thanks,

CARL

All-

I don't have written notes, but I did scan through the flights to find 
when flight maneuvers were done. These are in the "summary of flights" 
table on web page -
http://www.atd.ucar.edu/~dcrogers/ProgSci/PressureRake/
and show location of rake, time period, range of speeds, and altitude.

Carl,

That log directory was used only for checking whether people were
uploading files to our upload directory.  (No one ever did.)  I expect
that PI Jorgen Jensen <jbj@ucar.edu> has the information you seek.

Chris,

According to my records RF15 took place on 13 January 2006.  It has
only one takeoff and landing.  The data for which I'm looking (according
to Jorgen) has the plane coming back for some adjustments between each
of the flights.  The pilot's report specifically has 20 January 2006 as
the flight dates.

Good luck, and please let me know the results of your search.
I'd like to archive the pertinent files.

Chris,

Do you have any raw ADS files from the 3 Progressive Science flights that
took place on 20 January 2006?  They would have been RF16, RF17 and RF18.
I have no record of them, but Jorgen has a pilot's Flight Report from that
day.

Ron

Ken,

Thanks for your two contributions.  I unzipped the movie, and it created
the subdirectory  "__MACOSX" with a single file:  ._502rf14_spin.mov

Is this directory & file needed to view the movie when it is posted on
our web site?  I was just planning to post the movie file alone.

Ron

Ken,

The actual movie file unzipped in the parent directory.  A separate
file (1497 bytes with the leading .) was created in the subdirectory.
Linux said it was an "AppleDouble encoded Macintosh file."

I'll let you know when the web page is up with the links, and you can
try it out.

Ken,

I just viewed your PDF file (ProgSci 2006-06-21.pdf) in my Firefox browser
with Adobe Reader 7.0 installed.  All frames look fine except for #15 which
has only a large black rectangle under the title "Visualization Tools - GFS
variables".  (Worked this way whether I was using Windows or Linux)

Ken,

I have updated the Progressive Science web page and added the
presentations given to me so far.  You can view what I have
at the URL:
      http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Projects/ProgSci/Workshop.html
(I can change the movie link text if you would like to provide a
title of your own.)

Laura,

I got the PowerPoint, but the movie isn't at the URL:
    http://acd.ucar.edu/~liwen/hiaper/502rf01_titl.mov
which is the link in the web URL you sent me.

(You're welcome!)

Shanhu:

You will see by reading the message below that Jorgen Jensen is unable 
to respond to this request in the near term and has asked me to get 
involved. (I have been working closely with Jorgen and others on getting 
the GV data processing issues resolved, i.e., pressure corrections, 
temperature recovery factors, etc.) Ron Ruth and I will determine what 
parameters were used in the data set that Leslie Lait received and reply 
to the email accordingly. We will copy you on the reply. Let me know if 
you have any other questions regarding this.

Regards,
Dick

Hi Leslie,

I thought i gave your response to your email.  But somehow I 
forgot.  I had a conversation with Jorgen Jensen over phone several 
weeks ago, and he told me that he thinks the theta values are 
good.  But he is discussing with his colleagues in more detail - so 
this email is for this.   Thank you for patience and for your help.
best wishes
shanhu

Leslie:

I am responding to your inquiry regarding theta measurements on the 
HIAPER aircraft during Progressive Science Missions.

The data set that was forwarded to you is considered to be preliminary 
and the final validated data set has not be archived. We have been 
working on enhancement factors to the various state parameters such as 
temperature and pressure. The factors are due to the airflow around the 
aircraft and the position of the sensors and are used to "correct" the 
raw measurements. Because these factors had not been fully determined at 
the release of the preliminary data set there are uncertainties in the 
scientific instrument data values. For the theta calculation the air 
data computer ("aviation")ambient temperature (ATA_A) values were used 
and for pressure the "scientific" values were used (PSFC). The aviation 
temperature is a high quality instrument (actually the same model as the 
  science instrument), and the science quality pressure instrument 
(PSFC) is high quality, but was calibrated from the aviation pressure 
measurement for an absolute calibration during progressive science. The 
RAF is currently working with data from the TREX project along with the 
Progressive Science data and some calibration flights to determine the 
enhancement factors and verify the accuracy of the aviation measurements 
(over which we have not control).

In summary, we have every reason to believe that the aviation 
measurements AT_A, PS_A (ambient pressure) and the scientific 
measurement PSFC which was calibrated from PS_A are accurate to +/- 1.0 
degrees C and +/- 1.0 millibar. The reason for our confidence in these 
measurements is the instrument manufacturer's specifications, the 
aircraft manufacturer's requirements and the FAA requirements for 
accuracy. However, there are two caveats. One, we cannot stand behind 
these accuracies until we have finished our independent calibrations and 
determined enhancement factors. And secondly, the aviation measurements, 
while we feel are of high quality, have some filtering and time delays 
on the order of several seconds and should be considered as "mean" 
values in the preliminary data set and this should be taken into 
consideration in maneuvering flight (steep climbs and descents and 
steeply banked turns) where phasing is critical. Mean values for theta 
should be within the accuracies stated above until further verification. 
The final data set will have the "best" correction factors and phasing 
we can achieve.

I hope this is not too confusing and helps answer your question. I am 
not sure what you mean by "odd" theta values or by the beginning of 
flight (first 5 minutes after takeoff?). Let me know if you have further 
questions.

Regards, Dick

PS: I have appended the response from our data manager, Ron Ruth, as to 
the actual measurements used in the theta calculation.

Dick,

Thanks for sending these messages along.

So far as I know, the preliminary data made available to all Progressive
Science participants came from our anonymous ftp site.  All data were
output at 1sps.  The files can be found here:
    /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/

 From the header, RF01's data were processed on 26 January 2006 using
nimbus processor rev. 3172.  (Other flights were processed between
23 and 26 January 2006 using the same revision.)

Reference variables:
    PSX:   PSF (50sps)
    PSXC:  PSFC  (PSF, QCX -- not QCXC)
    QCX:   QCR (50sps)
    QCXC:  QCRC  (QCR, PSF)
    TTX:   TT_A (2sps)
    ATX:   AT_A (2sps)

Dick,

Thanks for sending these messages along.

So far as I know, the preliminary data made available to all Progressive
Science participants came from our anonymous ftp site.  All data were
output at 1sps.  The files can be found here:
    /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/data/

 From the header, RF01's data were processed on 26 January 2006 using
nimbus processor rev. 3172.  (Other flights were processed between
23 and 26 January 2006 using the same revision.)

Reference variables:
    PSX:   PSF (50sps)
    PSXC:  PSFC  (PSF, QCX -- not QCXC)
    QCX:   QCR (50sps)
    QCXC:  QCRC  (QCR, PSF)
    TTX:   TT_A (2sps)
    ATX:   AT_A (2sps)

Ron

Hi Ron,

Can we make the ProgSci data available to one of Chuck Wilson's co- 
workers? I spoke o him, and he is aware that the data is preliminary  
and that a final data set is expected ready by January.

Many thanks, Jorgen

Dear Ron,

  My name is John Cagle, and I work for Chuck Wilson at the University of Denver. I was referred to you by Jorgen Jensen for data relating to Progressive Science. We are performing data reduction and analysis  for flights occurring between 11-22-2005 and 12-19-2005. To do this, we need the ambient pressure, temperature, true air speed, and the time associated with each data point. Would it be possible for me to access the file/s which contains these data? Thank you very much.

Kind Regards,
John

John,

The data are in netCDF format.  You can get the files via ftp via a browser
or ftp client.  Grab and peruse the plain-text README file first.  Let me
know if you have any problems or questions.

Hello Ron,

  I have a few questions regarding the files. I've never used net cdf files before, so I have been searching the internet for directions on opening them. I am a little confused, do I need to write a C program with the netcdf.h header to be able to open them or did I completely misunderstand what I read?

-John

John,

A lot depends on what you plan to do with the data.  Here at RAF we have
a few tools that we use to examine and manipulate data from our files.
You can get info on them at the URL:
       http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Software/
If you are using a Linux system, "ncplot" is a good choice. For Windows,
try "aeros."  Some commercial software, like Matlab and IDL, have a netCDF
interface.

If you plan to use netCDF files with your own hand-written software,
you will probably want to get the free netCDF package (available for a
variety of OSs).  See the writeup at the URL:
      http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Bulletins/b9appdx_D.html
and the URLs that you find in that web page.  There is a netCDF utility
(ncdump) that will translate a complete netCDF file into an ASCII file that
can be easily imported to something like Windows Access.  And we do have a
Linux utility that will translate a netCDF file to ASCII with an option to
use the NASA Ames Data Exchange Format, if you're familiar with it.

Hope this is enough to get you started.

Ron

Jorgen,

(As if you don't have enough to do!!!)

I have come to a stopping point preparing the ProgSci documentation web
site.  I don't know if you intend to include all of the documents listed
below, but a goodly number of them should be ready before the site is
released to everyone.  A leading ? signifies an optional, but desirable,
page (at least in my mind).
    Scientific overview / Project Description page
    List of Project participants
    PM's QA Report
    Aircraft Instrumentation List
    Categorized Variable List (Allen has template)
?  Instrument reports from other participants
?  Summary of Instrument Calibration Factors
    IRU Performance Summary (info not in pilot reports)
    Mission Summaries/Descriptions (for each flight)
?  Mission results and education opportunities page
?  Flight-hour Summary
    Aircraft configurations:
     front view external -- if available
     lateral view external (left, right) -- if available
     floor plan, cabin layout
?  Project photos -- if available
    email list info -- if extant
?  sanitized chat logs (I must find out from Steve Williams whether
     CDS will be sanitizing them.  You may just want to archive them
     as is and not make them publicly available.)

Except for adding flight-related information needed from you, I have
finished the following web pages:
    Flight Summary Information Matrix (including whole-flight plots:
     TD, Alt, XY, XYZ vs. time)
    LRT netCDF production data catalog
    Variable List from LRT netCDF file
    Output Data netCDF LRT header example
    Research Flight Reports (without IRU drift/error data)

When I have enough information, I can complete the following pages:
    MSS Directory List (RAF)
    MSS Directory List (ATD)
    Pages related to high-rate production data (Do you plan to produce
     a high-rate data set for this project?)

The prototype web site can be viewed at the URL:
    http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/ATD_only/Projects/ProgSci/
Some of the links are dead, because their referenced pages are not yet
ready.  Please let me know when you want me to release the site to the
public and what pages you plan to include.  That way I can hide all of
the dead links until their referenced pages are ready (at some later
date).

The production data files have been archived to the Mass Store and are
presently available via the NCAR/EOL Automated Data Retrieval web page:
    http://www.eol.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/
and I also made an entry in the RAF Archived-Data Catalog:
    http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/data_catalog.html

Finally, the preliminary data still are available on the EOL ftp site
in the directory:
    /net/ftp/pub/archive/RAF-projects/ProgSci/
They are in the data/ subdirectory along with some pressure-rake files
in a separate rake/ sub-subdirectory.  I assume that you would like me
to remove them.  (Please verify.)

Also, please let me know what to do with the other subdirectories:
images/  log/  reports/.  (Should the entire ProgSci directory be
removed?)

Thanks.

Ron

Scot,

I'm hoping I'm asking the right person.

In the absence of Steve, do you know whether CDS harvested (and possibly
sanitized and archived) the chat logs for RAF's Progressive Science project
on the GV?  The flight dates were from 22 November 2005 through 13 January
2006.

Thanks for checking.

Jorgen,

I'm looking over the present status of the Progressive Science
documentation web site, and there is a lot of work to be done.
In fact, very little has been done other than to outline the
home page and complete the pilot flight reports.

First, the preliminary netCDF files which I put onto EOL's ftp site,
are still available.  Should these be removed?  Also, I noticed
that /jnet/productiondata/ has a set of files which were run in
late January/early February 2007.  If these are the final production
files, please let me know; I need to archive them.  I can then create
the various catalogs and pages that rely on information from them.
Do you plan to do a high-rate run?

Somewhere I found 5 mission types (New Particle Formation, CHAPS, START,
DOCIMS and Static Defect) and the flights which had been assigned to
each of them.  Do these designations need explanation?  I certainly
would like to see a brief writeup on them.

Attached is an abbreviated list of things I think should be done for
the web site.  All don't have to be complete before we release it,
but a number of tasks surely must be done before the site can be
called useful.  Ones starting with a question mark are optional
and can be added later, if desired.

I'm sure you will have questions, since the list is so brief,
but all I really need to know now is whether the data files in
/jnet/productiondata/ are the ones to be archived and released.
That way I can begin creating a bunch of the web pages for which
I'm responsible.

Thanks.

Ron

Jorgen,

Sorry I didn't include this in my previous message.  Here's where to find
the site in its development (prerelease) directory:

Ron,
I don't think we did any sanitizing or have the Progressive Science
chat logs as we didn't do any DM for that project. I guess it's time
to revisit the chat log issue!
