[GMT 12/22/05 17:41:22] <DaveR-Jeffco> Is it possible that data records have piled up in a buffer on the terminal window that was used to run rserial ? (maybe stupid question) 
[GMT 12/22/05 17:42:41] <ads-G5> I don't think so -- we killed the reserials with ctl-c and dsm308 has been rebooted as well [SteveO]

[GMT 12/22/05 17:48:09] <ads-G5> I meant "df", but your same answer applies...
[GMT 12/22/05 17:48:27] <wasinger-jeffco> it seams that the WCN counter is giving us some bad serial data and is flooding that fifo...
[GMT 12/22/05 17:49:11] <wasinger-jeffco> on the server type ps aux | grep rserial and see if any are still running... 
[GMT 12/22/05 17:49:22] <ads-G5> From our working rserial session, this is what we got:

[GMT 12/22/05 17:57:10] <ads-G5> ...is what we get now.  We also had 2 more "no space" messages -- 1 on irig_in_0 and another on dsma2d_in_1
[GMT 12/22/05 17:57:33] <LauraPan-ML> Thanks. I will follow on with chat. hope to have good CO gradient today.
[GMT 12/22/05 17:58:54] <wasinger-jeffco> ads-G5, all "no space" messages are just from dsm308 right?
[GMT 12/22/05 17:59:55] <ads-G5> Thats correct
[GMT 12/22/05 18:01:03] <LauraPan-ML> AlCooper-G5, Al, to follow up the morning request of your help, it will be really good if for the final segment GV climbs  to 47K.  It will give us a chance to have a coverage of the chemical trasnition layer.  
[GMT 12/22/05 18:01:10] <wasinger-jeffco> Dave, could we connect the WCN counter after the DSM has started up?
[GMT 12/22/05 18:01:13] <Teresa-GV> DaveR: The DSM problem is quite a shame, since the WCN is working fine up here at 12.5 km today.

[GMT 12/22/05 18:02:26] <DaveR-Jeffco> You should be able to cycle WCN power any time. After it is powered up again, confirm that sample flow is 300 (cc/min).
[GMT 12/22/05 18:03:38] <Teresa-GV> DaveR: I must have jinxed things; just noticed the wick is dried out again.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:04:45] <wasinger-jeffco> before you power up the WCN verify that dsm308's other sensors are recording (after you power cycle 308 again)
[GMT 12/22/05 18:05:43] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- it seems to have trouble staying wet. I suspect there may be air bubbles in the tubing. It's a problem that we need to investigate further, probably in lab with the instrument cover removed. 
[GMT 12/22/05 18:07:53] jnolan (jnolan@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:10:39] <ads-G5> We rebooted dsm308, saw good a/d values for over 2min, then turned on WCN.  Has been working OK for ~3min.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:10:59] <wasinger-jeffco> good...
[GMT 12/22/05 18:11:29] <Teresa-GV> DaveR:  How long should it take for WCN to warm up?  
[GMT 12/22/05 18:11:56] <Teresa-GV> DaveR: We cycled power at about 11:12 mtn time.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:13:08] <Teresa-GV> DaveR:  Just came out of warmup phase, but the flow is low at 160 cc/min
[GMT 12/22/05 18:15:29] <Teresa-GV> DaveR:  For a few seconds after warmup phase, the WCN indicated adequate water, but now is again dry.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:18:35] <Teresa-GV> DaveR:  flow on WCN is stll too low, staying in the low 160's
[GMT 12/22/05 18:19:52] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- suspect that low sample flow is due to high altitude. Total flow target is 600, TFCN_WCN
[GMT 12/22/05 18:21:13] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- WCN warm up time should be <1 minute. It's based on achieving setpoint temps, and it has already been there so it should recover quickly after power on/off.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:21:26] <Teresa-GV> DaveR:  Thanks.  Do you want me to do anything with the instrument during this flight?
[GMT 12/22/05 18:22:40] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- Suggest prodding it when you are at lower altitudes. In the past, it recovers flow control <38kft and can get wet when <~25kft. 
[GMT 12/22/05 18:23:48] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa- If WCN has been on the m-himil side tap, you could change it to the forward tap; should have higher pressure there.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:23:56] <Teresa-GV> DaveR:  Thanks, I'll try to revive it when we descend.

[GMT 12/22/05 18:32:24] <Teresa-GV> Also, for the record, WCN flow rates only increased to about 200 cc/min.  Will hope for better luck at lower alts.

[GMT 12/22/05 18:38:04] <AlCooper-G5> what can I do for you?
[GMT 12/22/05 18:38:05] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Al- Eroll isn't flying because he said 40K+ clearance wasn't given, yet I see you're at 41K.  Want to try some OJT and do a drop for the GPS occultation?
[GMT 12/22/05 18:39:25] <AlCooper-G5> No, we won't be permitted to continue at this altitude much longer. We're required to descend soon to FL280, and I doubt I'll have time.
[GMT 12/22/05 18:40:07] <AlCooper-G5> (couldn't have dropped here anyway because it's a congested airway)

[GMT 12/22/05 20:08:41] <jeffs> It looks like we have been getting data.  Last flight track I had for you showed a circular pattern over the ocean
[GMT 12/22/05 20:09:02] <ads-G5> Yes satcom dropped out
[GMT 12/22/05 20:09:44] <SteveOncley-G5> Circles were simply while negotiating with ATC.  We're now underway to our first DOCIMS circle, starting at 31.5, 124.5.

[GMT 12/22/05 20:15:55] <JanetScannell-Jeffco> There was a satcom drop out for about 30 minutes, maybe due to location of flight.  The flight may be outside of the satcom region and the satcom must redial to reestablish a connection.
[GMT 12/22/05 20:18:00] <AlCooper-G5> Dean - I suspect you probably sent a set of instructions that we never received because of satcom dropout?
[GMT 12/22/05 20:26:21] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Al-  I haven't yet but will if you want them.  They are a bit lengthy so I would break them down into smaller segments -- might clog up chat for a bit.

[GMT 12/22/05 22:33:53] <AlCooper-G5> Will give transitions through tropopause that you wanted.
[GMT 12/22/05 22:35:43] <LauraPan-ML> My hope is that you will request for me a climb before final approach to get high to 47K before landing.
[GMT 12/22/05 22:35:54] <LauraPan-ML> That will clear over the trnsition layer.
[GMT 12/22/05 22:38:08] <AlCooper-G5> Sorry, can't do that. Would add significantly to the flight time and fuel consumption. Need to do a normal approach at end of flight to expedite.

[GMT 12/22/05 23:05:49] <LauraPan-ML> Based on the forecast, you will stay in trop if going 41K home. Let me know if you touches tropopause when you get to the altitiude. The web ION is very slow in updating. 
[GMT 12/22/05 23:06:22] <LauraPan-ML> About the Rotor, are you working to avoid it?
[GMT 12/22/05 23:07:45] <MelShapiro-G5> L., are there wave clouds over the mtns? What is shown on the latest satellite image? Have the winds increased at the Mesa/Foothills Labs? These can be viewed on the RAP Wx Site.
[GMT 12/22/05 23:08:49] <jeffs> mel, yes there is wave cloud activity in the front range, the satellite view may be blocked partially by ci
[GMT 12/22/05 23:11:22] <jeffs> Mel, in case you are not reading the progsci page, there have been pilot reports of severe turublence at22 and 15 thousand feet,

[GMT 12/22/05 23:37:54] <Teresa-gv> Cliff, how are you doing?
[GMT 12/22/05 23:37:58] <jeffs> Al, I think that is a good idea, most of the severe reports were lower
[GMT 12/22/05 23:38:35] <jeffs> Also, I misread the date on the terminal forcast I sent, the one I need to send is better, and follows:
[GMT 12/22/05 23:38:49] <SteveOncley-G5> wasinger-jeffco: "hyper" is kind of stuck, acting as though it has a stuck "enter" key.  If we open a text terminal window, it scrolls continously.
[GMT 12/22/05 23:39:48] <SteveOncley-G5> In trying to debug this, I notice a bunch of "postmaster" processes (using "top").  One has taken over 100min of CPU time.  Is this normal?
[GMT 12/22/05 23:40:18] <jeffs> for Kden 0000 to 0200 Z on 23 december, wind 310 and 9 knots vis 6 miles, ceiling 20 kfeet AGL, few clouds at 8000 feet agl, sc clouds at 14 kfeet, and broken at 20 kfeet
[GMT 12/22/05 23:41:21] <SteveOncley-G5> BTW: I had to ssh from another laptop in order to run "top" because of the stuck key issue, but the ssh window acts fine.
[GMT 12/22/05 23:42:50] <AlCooper-G5> thanks, jeff, I was having trouble getting that (because of apparent need of a java tool in this computer) but found a way around that and downloaded the TAFs for DEN and BJC. Passed them forward.
[GMT 12/22/05 23:43:04] <Jcowan-Jeffco> SteveOncley-G5, I cannot find John W. around right now.  I think he might have gone for the day.
[GMT 12/22/05 23:43:20] <AlCooper-G5> I gather it's not too windy outside?
[GMT 12/22/05 23:43:46] <SteveOncley-G5> It is getting to be about that time.  Thanks.
