[GMT 12/01/05 16:28:24] <ChrisWebster-GV> turbulant take-ff.  Might get sick already
[GMT 12/01/05 16:28:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> satcom died and wouldn't restart on the ramp.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:28:41] <ChrisWebster-GV> finally came back.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:29:07] <ChrisWebster-GV> super f*cking turbulant.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:29:39] <ChrisWebster-GV> ground database didn't get started correctly.  Im going to maunally try and get it going.

[GMT 12/01/05 16:35:55] <ChrisWebster-GV> One of the nimbus config files didn't get in place, so a brief scare at the end of the runway with no IRS data.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:36:06] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> OK. Otherwise is everything else OK?

[GMT 12/01/05 16:40:58] <RonRuth-BJC> Chris, I replied to Janet's email this morning asking basically the same question.  I'll see what she replies.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:41:42] <ChrisWebster-GV> Ron, current.png "cannot be displayed because it contains errors", it's 4.5K
[GMT 12/01/05 16:41:44] <ChrisWebster-GV> that's what I got first flight also.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:42:14] <RonRuth-BJC> What is "current.png"?
[GMT 12/01/05 16:42:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> Jorgen, I think so.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:43:15] <ChrisWebster-GV> The current PNG image.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:45:37] <ChrisWebster-GV> p.s.  current.png is coming up (or has constantly updating date/time stamp).
[GMT 12/01/05 16:47:30] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> I think we better keep an eye on the total amount transfered; we pay be the byte, so if it is an infinite loop, then we need to stop the upload - somehow.

[GMT 12/01/05 16:56:48] <ChrisWebster-GV> Ron, I used xv to try to look at the .png file, it contains an SQL command from nimbus.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:56:54] <ChrisWebster-GV> Something is getting crossed.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:57:48] <RonRuth-BJC> Chris, Do you know the script's name and where it is running?
[GMT 12/01/05 16:58:46] <ChrisWebster-GV> Gordon, chaps and cabin dsm's went out.  I rebooted all.
[GMT 12/01/05 16:59:12] <GordonM-FL> I saw that. I'm watching them
[GMT 12/01/05 16:59:14] <AlCooper-GV> Now having data problems here, for the record. Should be nearing jet...
[GMT 12/01/05 16:59:29] <ChrisWebster-GV> Ron, I don't know anything about what she setup, just that ldm moves files. 
[GMT 12/01/05 17:00:06] <ChrisWebster-GV> Ron, look for files called on syrah or malbec called progsci_*
[GMT 12/01/05 17:00:18] <AlCooper-GV> and back OK now...
[GMT 12/01/05 17:00:39] <ChrisWebster-GV> see if those are valid PNG.

[GMT 12/01/05 17:20:53] <RonRuth-BJC> Chris, There are png files only in ~ldm/images/ but the newest one is May 13th (p3.2003061004.test.png);  My guess is that no new images are coming in, and the script is transferring the search results instead of the file (which it, of course, shouldn't do).
[GMT 12/01/05 17:22:06] <JohnCowan-GV> Rebooting MPDB and nose.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:22:19] <ChrisWebster-GV> The file up here has a nimbus SQL command in it.  there is something else going on...
[GMT 12/01/05 17:22:53] <AlCooper-GV> another data gap here, at least as displayed. Last I saw, we were up to 60 m/s wind after coming into Nebraska. No sig.turbulence yet.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:23:35] <AlCooper-GV> and now back up...
[GMT 12/01/05 17:33:43] <ChrisWebster-GV> 3/4 reverted to old.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:34:49] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Any idea why reboots of DSMs was needed?
[GMT 12/01/05 17:35:32] <AlCooper-GV> up to 70 m/s cross-wind now. It's really clear the pressure gradient driving this jet: Big decrease in GPS altitude while flying constant pressure.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:35:55] <GordonM-FL> Apparently a bug in the new code, so we're going with a previous version
[GMT 12/01/05 17:36:05] <AlCooper-GV> For 
[GMT 12/01/05 17:37:13] <AlCooper-GV> For Teresa: CO says 53 ppbv; seem OK?

[GMT 12/01/05 17:40:00] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> I think Teresa left JeffCo 10 minutes ago - complete with coat and mittens.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:44:05] <AlCooper-GV> Wind is now near 75 m/s (150 kts), the max we saw in the plots this morning, so I think we hit the core of this about right and in time.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:45:35] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Any turbulence?
[GMT 12/01/05 17:46:00] <ChrisWebster-GV> none.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:46:22] <ADS-GV> And we are happy about that <grin>.

[GMT 12/01/05 17:47:51] <GordonM-FL> Chris, anything I can do to check ldm?
[GMT 12/01/05 17:48:45] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Jim Huning, Roger and Karyn sends their congratulations!
[GMT 12/01/05 17:49:04] <ChrisWebster-GV> When we came back from INDOEX in the C130 we crossed the jet stream outside SFO, we were we seeing 150m/s wind (or something very strong) and there was no turbulence.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:49:20] <pavel-jeffco> Al - CO reading seems reasonable. Teresa is off line.
[GMT 12/01/05 17:50:24] <ChrisWebster-GV> GordonM-FL ldm itself is working, it wasn't saving the nimbus files earlier, typo with that slow satcom typing, I'm now re-transfering enough files get the database going...
[GMT 12/01/05 17:58:19] <LauraPan-GV> a note for STARTers: as te wind speed is droping, theta going up, the RH has droped from 16% to 5% - we are into the stratosphere!
[GMT 12/01/05 17:58:52] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Al, how is the D-value behaving now?
[GMT 12/01/05 18:02:18] <KenBowman-TAMU> Laura, very cool (and dry).
[GMT 12/01/05 18:08:44] <LauraPan-GV> we thought to cover all the way to 40kts contour east of the jet core. not sure what lat lon that is looking like. could you check near real time data?

[GMT 12/01/05 18:11:17] <LauraPan-GV> yes
[GMT 12/01/05 18:11:37] <LauraPan-GV> we are about to turn around
[GMT 12/01/05 18:12:18] <LauraPan-GV> the wind speed is ~27m/s ~54kts?
[GMT 12/01/05 18:13:33] <KenBowman-TAMU> Yes, ~52 kts
[GMT 12/01/05 18:13:59] <AlCooper-GV> now approaching the end of our leg. WS has dropped to about 60 kts, and it looks as if we have covered this pretty well. Jorgen, we still have a gradient, but reduced a little, I think.
[GMT 12/01/05 18:14:37] <LauraPan-GV> we estimated more than 2 hrs for this leg now done under 1.8 hr
[GMT 12/01/05 18:15:00] <LauraPan-GV> should have more time for stacking and profiling
[GMT 12/01/05 18:15:54] <KenBowman-TAMU> Laura, I don't have a good way to answer your question about location of 40 kt isotach.
[GMT 12/01/05 18:16:46] <LauraPan-GV> okay, we are climbing
[GMT 12/01/05 18:17:19] <LauraPan-GV> will try to get to 40kft and stack back
[GMT 12/01/05 18:24:36] <LauraPan-GV> we reached 40kft, T profile  is going along isotherm, very stratosphere. RH ~ 1%
[GMT 12/01/05 18:25:18] <LauraPan-GV> theta is ~ 370K
[GMT 12/01/05 18:28:37] <LauraPan-GV> Ron, could people the on ground get the data stream now?

[GMT 12/01/05 18:35:49] <AlCooper-GV> I'll include some notes here re data quality:  (1) IRS #2 still produces all zero values.
[GMT 12/01/05 18:36:57] <AlCooper-GV> (2) all 4 temperatures now quite close together, and all in agreement with AT_A (aircraft-avionics T)
[GMT 12/01/05 18:38:05] <AlCooper-GV> (3) WI has a consistent but small offset, about +0.3 m/s here were the true WI is probably 0
[GMT 12/01/05 18:41:03] <AlCooper-GV> (4) TASs are in good agreement exc TASF, which is about 2 m/s higher than the others. TAS_A from the aircraft avionics agrees with all exc TASF (perhaps 0.1 m/s lower)

[GMT 12/01/05 18:43:47] <RonRuth-BJC> Laura, The public-access data stream via ION is not working.  The system program that provides these data for ION is failing with a segmentation fault, and I do not know how to fix it.  I just restarted it again, but I don't expect it to keep going, and I don't know if it will work properly.

[GMT 12/01/05 18:47:29] <schanot_jeffco> -75 is really pretty good for a chilled mirror device.  We get ultra low humidity data from the TDL
[GMT 12/01/05 18:47:50] <LauraPan-GV> thank you Ron
[GMT 12/01/05 18:48:43] <ChrisWebster-GV> Ron & Laura the database on the ground is not being updated, pressure rake data is causing it to hicup.  I would need to restart nimbus on the plane to fix it.
[GMT 12/01/05 18:48:44] <AlCooper-GV> (6) TDL MR (strat) is about 16 ppm. ??  I don't see much variation in the signal, but I've only been looking for a short time.
[GMT 12/01/05 18:50:46] <TeresaCampos_Jeffco> Al, do you mean that the tdl variable pp2f_lhl is reading 16?  If so, the units are counts per sec, and that is near or at the LOD.
[GMT 12/01/05 18:51:01] <AlCooper-GV> (7) QCs are in good agreement, but a few % above the corresponding value from the AC system
[GMT 12/01/05 18:52:44] <AlCooper-GV> Teresa, no, PP2F_LDL is about 160 and quite steady exc for 1-Hz noise
[GMT 12/01/05 18:53:46] <TeresaCampos_Jeffco> Al, thanks.  That's good news.  The MR variable is using a constant P and T (400 mb and 0C) to calc a real time MR, so it will be off quite a bit.

[GMT 12/01/05 19:23:23] <ChrisWebster-GV> ok.  Charlie is aeros connecting ground to orion?
[GMT 12/01/05 19:23:24] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> I am seeing a map without the registration problem.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:23:36] <GordonM-FL> Chris, I've fixed files   up to 1899.  files 2017-2032 are new and I will fix them.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:24:03] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> same here...
[GMT 12/01/05 19:24:06] <ChrisWebster-GV> Tersa can you see about our 1st 30  minutes from take off?
[GMT 12/01/05 19:24:15] <ChrisWebster-GV> Gordon, where are they?
[GMT 12/01/05 19:24:26] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> I think so.  The eastern edge is just north of Limon.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:24:54] <GordonM-FL> The're in ~ldm/data/files 
[GMT 12/01/05 19:24:56] <ChrisWebster-GV> Gordon, we should output the sed to another directory, not bother in place, then we know which ones to run.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:25:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> oh, I see, in the 'new' directory?
[GMT 12/01/05 19:26:14] <GordonM-FL> 'new' was a temporary one - I copied them back to files.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:26:45] <GordonM-FL> My script now shouldn't change files that are already fixed, so I can just run it again.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:26:47] <ChrisWebster-GV> ok, next round just leave them uncompressed in new.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:27:53] <ADS-GV> Chris, For the areos machine should it connect Real Time onboard.  Irt is displaying but not updateing.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:28:11] <ADS-GV> Chris that is at the avaps rack.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:28:43] <ChrisWebster-GV> Then connect ground, Charlie, there's a second windows machine that doesn't see the UDP broadcast.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:30:26] <ADS-GV> Chris, what is the server?
[GMT 12/01/05 19:30:43] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I noticed...
[GMT 12/01/05 19:30:48] <ChrisWebster-GV> ac-server
[GMT 12/01/05 19:31:35] <GordonM-FL> Chris, all the files in 'new' are ready for ingesting
[GMT 12/01/05 19:31:45] <ChrisWebster-GV> GoogleMaps & aeros people, data should be streaming in.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:32:14] <ADS-GV> Thanks chris that fixed it.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:32:48] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> google earth is working (plane is jumping whole states as the data base gets loaded)
[GMT 12/01/05 19:37:26] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> Charlie, are you using 'google earth' for windows to observe this flight too?  or are you refering to the web interface version.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:37:47] <ChrisWebster-GV> GordonM-FL second batch of files replaced a comma with the ' ....
[GMT 12/01/05 19:38:00] <ChrisWebster-GV> Google Earth should also be working.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:38:04] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I'm using Goole Earth. Google Maps seems to only allow on user logged in, which I assume is you.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:38:11] <stith> Al cooper, how are you doing?  
[GMT 12/01/05 19:38:30] <GordonM-FL> Chris: oops, I'll fix them
[GMT 12/01/05 19:38:36] <AlCooper-GV> for Teresa: PP2F_LHL is varying reasonably here, in the range 200+-50, in good (negative) correlation with temperature variations
[GMT 12/01/05 19:39:30] <AlCooper-GV> Jeff, Cooper's doing great! Playing in the stratosphere! 
[GMT 12/01/05 19:39:46] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> Charlie,  I'm not sure about the one user log in, Teresa is logged in as well.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:40:16] <stith> Al I'm off to the MAC--wish you were here!
[GMT 12/01/05 19:40:26] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Al: this sounds good.  On the test flight, 170-ish counts at 40+ kft corresponded to a -73C dewpoint. 
[GMT 12/01/05 19:40:30] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I'll try G Maps again then.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:45:41] <GordonM-FL> Chris, the 'new' files are ready again.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:47:54] <GordonM-FL> Aeros on the ground now shows data up to 19:47:21
[GMT 12/01/05 19:49:13] <schanot_jeffco> For tomorrow's flight.  Do we want the sunset time at 121W 18N at the surface or at 40K ft?
[GMT 12/01/05 19:52:55] <AlCooper-GV> at about 194420, there was a strange jump in one temperature but not in the others? Several other variables changed then also, including WS, so I'm note sure what to make of that. ATLH2 is now about 5C above the others.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:54:19] <stith> Al, This is kind of like the software problem that we had when we first had the data system running
[GMT 12/01/05 19:54:45] <stith> Gordon had a fix for that, however
[GMT 12/01/05 19:55:17] <schanot_jeffco> this thing with TTHL2 is not software.  
[GMT 12/01/05 19:55:31] <schanot_jeffco> We've seen it on several flights.
[GMT 12/01/05 19:55:42] <schanot_jeffco> have not resolved the problem yet
[GMT 12/01/05 19:55:51] <AlCooper-GV> This is shanhu.  I would like to fly from JeffCo  from 2 pm and stay around at 7 km  and reach W121m N18 at local time around 6 pm (which is sunset)
[GMT 12/01/05 19:56:07] <AlCooper-GV> and come back by fying 13 km. 
[GMT 12/01/05 19:56:32] <GordonM-FL> That's right, I don't have a fix for data jumps in data from the A2Ds
[GMT 12/01/05 19:56:36] <AlCooper-GV> Jorgen -- does that make sense to you -- sh
[GMT 12/01/05 19:57:11] <AlCooper-GV> what is A2ds?  -sh
[GMT 12/01/05 20:00:28] <LauraPan-GV> Teresa, do you have access to your data from the ground? Is CO doing okay?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:01:05] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> A2D "Analog 2 Digital"...  I noticed similar jumps while testing an A2D board here too.  not all channels jumped though on my board.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:02:42] <ADS-GV> Al S. we are going to swap the probes for the flight tomorrow to see if we can isolate what hardware is the problem.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:06:54] <GordonM-FL> Chris: my sql fixup script is  " sudo ~maclean/ldm/fixup.sh" you run it from the files directory
[GMT 12/01/05 20:07:26] <GordonM-FL> Chris: is there anything I can to so the files get to the db in real-time?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:07:51] <dickfriesen-jeffco> on all flights it has been tth2 with level shift. Either the probe or amp -probably not A2D
[GMT 12/01/05 20:08:59] <GordonM-FL> Perhaps it could be in the gain circuitry on the A2D though?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:10:09] <ChrisWebster-GV> GordonM-FL Yes, edit ~cjw/bin/exec_psql and insert your sed command somewhere after the gunzip
[GMT 12/01/05 20:12:19] <GordonM-FL> That did it - real-time aeros data on the ground!
[GMT 12/01/05 20:18:24] <ChrisWebster-GV> Nice!
[GMT 12/01/05 20:18:57] <ChrisWebster-GV> Keyboard on ads station is no longer responding, we have touchpad & buttons.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:19:49] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> Google Maps isn't updateing though..  my last recorded position of the GV is 10 mi east of Hoxie, KS
[GMT 12/01/05 20:20:00] <LauraPan-GV> could someone pass this news to the conference room where the daily briefing/planning meeting is in progress? I hope Bill Randel and Ken Bowman hear this and start look at the data.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:20:03] <ChrisWebster-GV> I just restarted the updater for that.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:20:45] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> chris, was that resp to me?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:20:53] <AlCooper-GV> for the record: The period with WI variations of about 0.2 m/s RMS (at about 2016) and again now (2022) doesn't feel at all serious. What I guess the airlines might call "light chop"? None of the turbulence encountered this flight felt at all uncomfortable (so far).

[GMT 12/01/05 20:21:15] <ChrisWebster-GV> yes, are you getting updates?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:21:53] <GordonM-FL> I'
[GMT 12/01/05 20:22:26] <GordonM-FL> Google map is getting updates: last one 20:24:39
[GMT 12/01/05 20:22:46] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> chris, the GV jumped to 200mi west on lincon, NB
[GMT 12/01/05 20:23:02] <AlCooper-GV> Teresa: PP2F_LHL jumped nicely as we descended. Now counts are about 10000 (and DPs still say about -38C).
[GMT 12/01/05 20:24:35] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> Gordon, which tab provides the flight clock on the google map interface.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:24:53] <GordonM-FL> You click on the balloon
[GMT 12/01/05 20:26:16] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> say, is the aeros track plot working for anyone? I don't get any track, even though the variables show up in ascii-list.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:27:22] <JohnWasinger-JeffCo> mine is updateing dynamically as well.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:28:02] <AlCooper-GV> temperatures are all back together now!
[GMT 12/01/05 20:28:02] <LauraPan-GV> I have track working for me
[GMT 12/01/05 20:28:12] <LauraPan-GV> I had to close the window a couple of times and reopen it
[GMT 12/01/05 20:28:15] <AlCooper-GV> Charlie, it works great in the air! We've been watching the tracks overlap as we fly this cross-section.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:28:53] <GordonM-FL> track plot:  make sure you don't select inertial data from irs#2 - we're not getting IRS#2 data
[GMT 12/01/05 20:30:27] <AlCooper-GV> wind speed increasing to about 100 kts again here (about 41.8 latitude, heading NE)
[GMT 12/01/05 20:31:20] <dickfriesen-jeffco> Al:
[GMT 12/01/05 20:31:48] <LauraPan-GV> Is Ron still in the chat room? Could you pass the news of aeros working on the groud to the crow in the conf room and FL3?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:32:07] <LauraPan-GV> I mean "crowd"
[GMT 12/01/05 20:32:27] <dickfriesen-jeffco> How do the winds from the air data computer and our inertial/gust probe derived winds agree?
[GMT 12/01/05 20:34:02] <AlCooper-GV> at 2036, it feels quite smooth although visually the WI variance isn't much different from that earlier, except it is much lower frequency. (I'm thinking about what variance to suggest using in TREX, and it's clear it will have to be filtered to match the aircraft response to characterize what we feel.)
[GMT 12/01/05 20:34:02] <AlCooper-GV> Dick:  I'll check. Earlier, they were pretty good.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:35:09] <CharlieMartin-Boulder> I got the aeros track plot running - turns out that the true heading variable isn't being found - relates to the recent "circles" addition, I'd guess.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:35:19] <ChrisWebster-GV> You have the data down there, tell us.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:36:55] <ChrisWebster-GV> Correct, two new variables got added to the track, thdg and tasx, but it should have asked you for the names....
[GMT 12/01/05 20:36:58] <AlCooper-GV> aircraft: 283/97. aeros: 291/50 m/s. Looks good! (does the aircraft display mag-corrected wind? Then they'd be about perfect.)
[GMT 12/01/05 20:37:32] KenBowman-TAMU (k-bowman@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:39:25] <dickfriesen-jeffco> Al; I am not sure if the a/c uses mag or true - fi that was your question? I will have to check.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:40:33] <AlCooper-GV> I'm puzzled by what appears to be a regular wave in THETA. I don't see it in temperature, but it may be that the scales don't have enough resolution. I'm wondering if the autopilot oscillates in altitude a little, giving us that regular wave? I can't see with enough resolution to see it anywhere else.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:42:58] <dickfriesen-jeffco> I am off to the dentist - would rather be flying - have a good flight!
[GMT 12/01/05 20:47:03] dickfriesen-jeffco (rbf@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 12/01/05 20:48:18] <LauraPan-GV> ken, as you may have seen aeros is working on the groud. You should be able to see real time data flow. Bill is interested in that but he may not have the setup.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:51:09] <schanot_jeffco> Hello GV.  I have an update for tomorrow.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:52:47] <schanot_jeffco> First option will be stratoCu with a 11 AM takeoff.  If conditions fall apart that still leaves us enough crew duty to delay and do shanhu's mission with a 1400 takeoff.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:54:04] <schanot_jeffco> We expect to have the new shroud for the dropsonde chute in hand by first thing tomorrow.  But, the stratoCu flight would still go forward without dropsondes.
[GMT 12/01/05 20:54:40] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Al:  Just saw your CO and TDL updates.  TDL seems okay.   In the case of CO, unfortunately I cannot see the data in the ground feed.  Also there is some mix-up with our analog signal output (either in my cable or in the DSM configuration) and the mixing ratios appearing in variable XCOMR do not reflect what's happening in the instrument.  
[GMT 12/01/05 20:55:26] <schanot_jeffco> We have determined that sunset at 18N and 121W will be at 1:27 CUT Saturday.  That is at the surface.  I didn't hear back if the altitude difference needed to be accounted for.

[GMT 12/01/05 21:59:04] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> My G maps still has a last data update at 20:54:21. 
[GMT 12/01/05 21:59:23] <ChrisWebster-GV> I'm sure there is a back log of data trying to come down.
[GMT 12/01/05 21:59:36] <GordonM-FL> Any guess at a reason?  Anyone using iridium?
[GMT 12/01/05 21:59:45] <ChrisWebster-GV> Actually I have to enter the new IP address into the ground ldm and restart it.  :(
[GMT 12/01/05 22:02:12] <GordonM-FL> Chris: might be good to grep /var/log/messages for ppp statistics about the # of bytes transfered
[GMT 12/01/05 22:02:42] <ChrisWebster-GV> Do we really want to know that?
[GMT 12/01/05 22:05:16] <schanot_jeffco> Hello g5.  Did anyone receive out plans for tommorrows mission?

[GMT 12/01/05 22:13:08] <ChrisWebster-GV> schanot_jeffco , yes we got the message, again, we'd like to know when they plan on making the final decision?
[GMT 12/01/05 22:15:22] <ChrisWebster-GV> Starting up the ldm.

[GMT 12/01/05 22:29:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> Ron, wake up!
[GMT 12/01/05 22:30:18] <RonRuth-BJC> Chris, dropped keyboard
[GMT 12/01/05 22:31:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> ya, sure.

[GMT 12/01/05 22:34:44] <schanot_jeffco> OK.  Slight adjustment to the plans.  StaroCu flight scheduled for 1200 TO.  Final decision at 0900 tomorrow.  Optional mission is Pacific Dust with 1430 TO.

[GMT 12/01/05 22:39:11] <ChrisWebster-GV> Google Maps should be back
[GMT 12/01/05 22:39:43] <schanot_jeffco> Jorgen is not available.  Because the StaroCu mission are the most difficult to catch, that option was given top priority for tomorrow's flight.
[GMT 12/01/05 22:40:51] <GordonM-FL> aeros and google map are up to 22:22 (~20 minutes behind)
[GMT 12/01/05 22:43:50] <ChrisWebster-GV> I think ldm is running full throttle to get the back log of data down.  I can baerly read telemarktips.com  :)
[GMT 12/01/05 22:45:59] <GordonM-FL> They're now 7 minutes behind. Made up 13 minutes in 5 minutes  2.3X real time! 
[GMT 12/01/05 22:46:17] <AlCooper-GV> we're now going to truncate this leg, descend to 13kft, and return for another pass through this instrusion. Then home (with sounding) after we see we are through it.
[GMT 12/01/05 22:48:10] bruning-JEFFCO (bruning@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 12/01/05 22:49:23] <AlCooper-GV> note re TDL water: it appeared to be the best indication of dry air, representing that intrusion, and we decided to rely on it to believe we were through it. Wind started back down, but was still 80 kts. Hope that's a good gamble.
[GMT 12/01/05 22:52:53] <RonRuth-BJC> Google now less than 3 minutes behind.

[GMT 12/01/05 23:01:05] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> (Fingers crossed)
[GMT 12/01/05 23:14:05] <AlCooper-GV> now planning a sounding along the line, climbing through this feature we have been studying before turning back to BJC. Sounding to 47kft.

[GMT 12/01/05 23:23:26] <schanot_jeffco> Can you give us an ETA for tonight?
[GMT 12/01/05 23:25:18] <AlCooper-GV> I'll check...
[GMT 12/01/05 23:29:02] <AlCooper-GV> Henry says 5:54; is that enough precision for you?
[GMT 12/01/05 23:31:08] <schanot_jeffco> This is Jorgen - Yes, but what about accuracy?
[GMT 12/01/05 23:37:34] <stith> Hi Laura-this is Brian R, just wondered how instruments were going.  Cheers!
[GMT 12/01/05 23:49:14] <LauraPan-GV> Hi Brian!
[GMT 12/01/05 23:49:59] <LauraPan-GV> We can't look at ozone onboard but rushan looked at the last flight data and it worked well.
[GMT 12/01/05 23:51:21] <LauraPan-GV> The TDL count is making sense and together with T and ws we are able to figure out exactly where we are w.r.t the intrusion. 
[GMT 12/01/05 23:51:35] <LauraPan-GV> The RH is working really well for me too
[GMT 12/01/05 23:52:10] <LauraPan-GV> are you going to be there at the landing?
[GMT 12/01/05 23:57:23] <ChrisWebster-GV> Teresa, TDL is still 1hz.  Is there supposed to be an init string that changes it from 1hz to something else?
[GMT 12/01/05 23:57:46] <AlCooper-GV> one more data-quality note: there is a significant difference here between the aircraft-avionics pressure and the data-system pressure at this altitude. The aircraft is flying 47kft pressure altitude, but we are showing 46440 or so.
