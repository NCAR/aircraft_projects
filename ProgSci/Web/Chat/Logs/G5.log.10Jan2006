[GMT 01/10/06 16:57:06] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> pavel-G5 How are things up there.  Last reported airspeed was 7 m/s !!!!!
[GMT 01/10/06 16:59:50] <pavel-G5> Chris, I think we are a bit faster than that. Things are Ok, doing speed runs now.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:03:01] <pavel-G5> BTW, in two fwd racks, Aeros is not updating in real time. Any suggestions? This is not critical, other laptops are Ok.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:03:25] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> pavel-G5 I can't log into the plane, ssh ads@hyper then cd /var/www/html and see if there is .kml file.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:04:00] <pavel-G5> Aha! I will try that. Thanks!
[GMT 01/10/06 17:06:28] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> Not sure about latops.  Can you ping 'hyper' from them ?

[GMT 01/10/06 17:10:04] <ads-G5> Chris, on one of the terminal windows you had open I am getting a fail to open output file message.  Everything else seems to be fine
[GMT 01/10/06 17:11:00] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> what's the title on that window?
[GMT 01/10/06 17:11:48] <Errol-GV> Chris - Dean is wondering about flt tracks, will they be up?
[GMT 01/10/06 17:11:49] <ads-G5> Its the bottom window and it just says terminal
[GMT 01/10/06 17:12:12] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> is satcom the window above it?

[GMT 01/10/06 17:12:52] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> we aren't getting any data down here.  Something happened with the satcom, it must have restarted.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:13:47] <ads-G5> Yes it looks like it restarted at 9:59
[GMT 01/10/06 17:14:19] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> is there a 'local address' line item you can find in that satcom window?
[GMT 01/10/06 17:14:27] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> you might have to scroll up some....
[GMT 01/10/06 17:14:46] <pavel-G5> Chris - no .kml file there.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:15:24] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> if you type 'psg update' on hyper, do you get any result?
[GMT 01/10/06 17:15:56] <pavel-G5> I can ping Hyper just fine, and this chat goes through as well. Gotta be aeros setup.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:16:12] <ads-G5> Local IP address 12.111.57.44
[GMT 01/10/06 17:18:42] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> did those laptops get any data at all (earlier)?
[GMT 01/10/06 17:19:52] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> greg, your error is why pavel isn't seeing a .kml file.  I Should be able to fix that.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:21:33] <pavel-G5> Right. I just looked - he'g getting "can't open .kml and .xml file"
[GMT 01/10/06 17:22:03] <pavel-G5> psg update printed out two lines, some S+ o.oo and 0.01 and such. Nothing else changed.
[GMT 01/10/06 17:22:54] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> it's running, .kml not being created because of permissions, working on it....

[GMT 01/10/06 19:01:16] <schanot_jeffco> so far
[GMT 01/10/06 19:21:06] <Teresa-GV> Al, we're planning to do the low alt maneuvers at about 2500 ft because there are clouds lower.
[GMT 01/10/06 19:26:05] <schanot_jeffco> OK
[GMT 01/10/06 19:26:57] <laptop4-g5> Ok, doing pitch maneuvers now at 2500 ft.
[GMT 01/10/06 19:27:40] <laptop4-g5> Went down to 300 ft on descent after sondes.
[GMT 01/10/06 19:29:18] <schanot_jeffco> Looks like a good, continuous descent for the comparison!
[GMT 01/10/06 19:30:34] <laptop4-g5> We were about 3 kft higher than the sonds for the most part durung descent.
[GMT 01/10/06 19:32:24] <ads-G5> Al just a heads up, we have got a service mirror light and rebalance light on the right dewpoint
[GMT 01/10/06 19:34:08] <laptop4-g5> Pavel here. Al, I know you want reverse heading along the wind. Is 6 knot cross wind a problem?
[GMT 01/10/06 19:38:22] <laptop4-g5> Al is at lunch I guess... well, will have to live with cross wind then...

[GMT 01/10/06 19:51:19] <schanot_jeffco> Greg:  are the dew pointers still tracking?
[GMT 01/10/06 19:51:38] <laptop4-g5> Autopilot did the headings. If they are off, the responsible party will be Gulfstream.
[GMT 01/10/06 19:54:18] <Teresa-GV> Al this is Greg,  the right one is not tracking anymore
[GMT 01/10/06 19:56:22] <schanot_jeffco> Greg:  I finally woke up and looked at AEROS, but thanks
[GMT 01/10/06 19:59:19] <schanot_jeffco> Greg:  Can't say I'm happy with the Dewpointer still working.  Hope we got the flags back on right
[GMT 01/10/06 20:01:17] <Teresa-GV> Yes, I was wondering that too.  Also my keyboard will not let me type, but the mouse still works

[GMT 01/10/06 20:11:34] <laptop4-g5> What do you mean?
[GMT 01/10/06 20:12:48] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> how much can you zoom in?
[GMT 01/10/06 20:13:07] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> how much detail does it have?  Can you see the truck in my driveway?  :)
[GMT 01/10/06 20:13:56] <laptop4-g5> I am not on the internet with it, but the cached map is good enough for any practical purpose.
