[GMT 12/09/05 00:11:50] <Jcowan-Jeffco> DeanLauritsen-GV, Mark wants to know what happened to give you confidence for a second drop?
[GMT 12/09/05 00:14:21] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> JohnWasinger-GV you weren't supposed to ftp to the ground.  You were supposed to ftp to hyper, where I rebuilt the code, Kurt's Circles work.  So either I botched the tar job, or you botched the ftp....
[GMT 12/09/05 00:17:29] <DeanLauritsen-GV> To Mark- first drop exitted the aircraft perfectly but the launch shutter hesitated for several seconds after launch switch was thrown and drop 1 data was nominal.  Drop 2, the shutter refused to open evenafter three attempts, so I removed the sonde.  I cycled the launcher when we were low after it had warmed for an hour and it worked normally.  Figured it would work okay on next drop after we climbed (it was still quite warm) and it did work prop
[GMT 12/09/05 00:17:32] <DeanLauritsen-GV> erly wiithout hesitation.  At 45Kft and plan to drop another.

[GMT 12/09/05 01:02:31] <SteveOncley-G5> (DaveR - RAF aerosol equipment status: RDMA is down with failed pump. I think it can be changed out in ~3 hours. Water CN seems to make useful "relative" data when we are below 18kft. 
[GMT 12/09/05 01:03:08] <SteveOncley-G5> (DaveR) - pressure rake has been making data entire flight. Few glimpses suggest it is working okay.

[GMT 12/09/05 01:10:58] <kurt_ads> John, Dave would like totry and pull the pump tonight.  He's not sure about fixing and re-installing.
[GMT 12/09/05 01:11:31] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, We are ready to offer what support we can.
[GMT 12/09/05 01:11:32] <kurt_ads> my guess would be the pump would not be able to be fixed or replaced in time for the flight tomorrow.
[GMT 12/09/05 01:11:54] <kurt_ads> but if we can get it out he can wwork on it tomorrow.
[GMT 12/09/05 01:12:28] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I thought he said that there was a spare here at Jeffco. If I knew where we could have it ready for him.
[GMT 12/09/05 01:12:51] <kurt_ads> He's aware of the two hours of support after landing and this shouldn't be an issue.

In RF04 the green light went off early in the flight and the instrument required a re-boot to work properly.  Since we are just aft, we are in a good spot to notice if the green light goes off.  Hope you have a good flight!

[GMT 12/09/05 19:26:58] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Laura, I ran out to get some carry out lunch.  Am back now.  Do you still need help?
[GMT 12/09/05 19:27:20] <LauraPan-GV> yes
[GMT 12/09/05 19:27:41] <LauraPan-GV> we need you to ask Rushan a question unless you know the answer
[GMT 12/09/05 19:27:54] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Okay, I'll call him.  What's the question?

[GMT 12/09/05 19:29:10] <LauraPan-GV> we are having some problem with airflow sensor. I will let John give yu the precise description of that. meanwhile we are trying to restrt that
[GMT 12/09/05 19:29:40] <LauraPan-GV> that will cause data interruption to the ozone instr. we wonder if we should cycle the power of ozone
[GMT 12/09/05 19:30:05] <LauraPan-GV> Ken, need to ask you something too
[GMT 12/09/05 19:30:31] <JohnWasinger-GV> power-cycled DSM306 to resolve PRAKE issue...
[GMT 12/09/05 19:31:07] <JohnWasinger-GV> (DSM has no relation to the ozone)
[GMT 12/09/05 19:31:14] <JohnWasinger-GV> (DSM306 has no relation to the ozone)
[GMT 12/09/05 19:32:10] <LauraPan-GV> John could you put your headset on so we can talk 
[GMT 12/09/05 19:32:27] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Laura and everyone.  If you do encounter a problem that requires recycling power to Rushan's ozone instrument, then please be sure to first follow Rushan's shutdown procedure.
[GMT 12/09/05 19:33:01] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Rushan records data to a compact flash card, and those can beccome corrupted if power is lost during a write (as most of you probably know).
[GMT 12/09/05 19:34:24] <JohnWasinger-GV> PRAKE reporting data now...
[GMT 12/09/05 19:35:08] <LauraPan-GV> John has just confirmed that there is no interruption to ozone and the issue has been resolved

[GMT 12/09/05 19:56:56] <KenBowman-TAMU> Laura, the best I can find is 12Z 200 hPa analysis.  Streamlines show stagnation point very near SW corner of UT.  The flow should be very weak in vicinity.
[GMT 12/09/05 19:58:06] <WasingerJohn-ads> I see 139.xxx 295.xxx 0.212xxx 0.003xxxxx accordingly

[GMT 12/09/05 20:02:59] <BillRandel-GV> Hi Ken - I think we're near that region, as winds are quite weak now
[GMT 12/09/05 20:03:42] <LauraPan-GV> looks like we have cut some corners - the wind right now is up tp 10 m/s from 5m/s
[GMT 12/09/05 20:06:41] <jeffs> ken--the height of the 300 mb surface, at the southwest corner of our track should be at about 9325 m.  How does that compare with the map values?

[GMT 12/09/05 20:40:03] <KenBowman-TAMU> LauraPan-GV, Yes, I am looking at the track.  The important thing is to cross the unstable manifolds (red), although it is good that you have a section through the stagnation point.  Are you going to fly another lap?
[GMT 12/09/05 20:41:17] <KenBowman-TAMU> I put 18Z 200 and 300 hPa geopotential height maps on the web page here, http://csrp.tamu.edu/hiaper/sections/hiaper_20051209T18Z.html, if you need to view them (and can).

[GMT 12/09/05 20:51:03] <KenBowman-TAMU> No, I think it will work fine.  The saddle point will continue to move E, so when you fly back the next circuit you should get a good section across unstable manifold W of saddle point.

[GMT 12/09/05 21:09:38] <cliff-gv> Teresa, not much happening.  Ozone seems to e ok, no "light out" at any time so far.  I wish I knew where we were.  CO moves up from around 115 or so to about 130 on occasion, no altitude change, still at 30-31 K ft
[GMT 12/09/05 21:11:03] <LauraPan-GV> We should be able to view web but it is is expensive. We may not choose to do it if we are comfortable about where we are w.r.t the feature
[GMT 12/09/05 21:11:54] <KenBowman-TAMU> LauraPan-GV, I think that will work well.  I can only see recent part of flight track, but if I remember right, you flew almost directly across the SW corner of UT.  That should cut through manifold near there.

[GMT 12/09/05 21:40:10] <KenBowman-TAMU> LauraPan-GV, it is OK to miss the hyperbolic point.  Not necessary to fly directly across it.  You should see changes in atmospheric parameters across the manifold, as air coming from different locations.
