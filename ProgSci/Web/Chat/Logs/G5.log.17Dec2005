[GMT 12/17/05 16:29:50] <ads-G5> Good Morning Chris
[GMT 12/17/05 16:29:59] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> morning.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:30:01] <ads-G5> This is David
[GMT 12/17/05 16:30:22] <ads-G5> I am waiting for the Data System to boot
[GMT 12/17/05 16:30:31] <ads-G5> well its booted obviously
[GMT 12/17/05 16:30:32] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> hi dave, 10-4.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:30:52] <ads-G5> i'm giving the time server time to do its thing
[GMT 12/17/05 16:31:04] <ads-G5> how many minutes does it need
[GMT 12/17/05 16:31:06] <ads-G5> ???
[GMT 12/17/05 16:31:36] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> not really sure.  I'll og in.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:31:51] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> You can get the browser up, and one of the bookmarks is 'timeserver'
[GMT 12/17/05 16:32:01] <ads-G5> ok
[GMT 12/17/05 16:33:00] <ads-G5> it says normal operation so i am going to start nimbus
[GMT 12/17/05 16:33:19] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ok.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:33:27] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> That's why my temps say -90C
[GMT 12/17/05 16:34:10] <ads-G5> please wait...
[GMT 12/17/05 16:35:00] <ads-G5> ok all dsms are good
[GMT 12/17/05 16:35:13] <ads-G5> starting aeros
[GMT 12/17/05 16:37:00] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Temps are still -90C
[GMT 12/17/05 16:40:03] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> aer you alive?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:40:34] <ads-G5> ok
[GMT 12/17/05 16:40:54] <ads-G5> i have all 4 temps on giving me volts
[GMT 12/17/05 16:41:06] <ads-G5> and they are all over the place
[GMT 12/17/05 16:41:13] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I assume 0 volts right now?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:41:29] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> p.s.  I'm running aeros from home connecting to plane.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:41:34] <ads-G5> yes
[GMT 12/17/05 16:41:40] <ads-G5> 0 volts input
[GMT 12/17/05 16:43:05] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Let me open voltage database, slow opening stuff from home.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:44:59] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ok, I see spikes also.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:45:09] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Normally you don't open this do you?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:45:23] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> 'this' being voltages
[GMT 12/17/05 16:46:31] <ads-G5> no, the reason i opened it was because there was more noise than usual in the cal program
[GMT 12/17/05 16:49:44] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I can look at some data from yesterday's flight.  But in general there isn't much I can do today...
[GMT 12/17/05 16:50:10] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Can you turn it to 5 volts?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:51:10] <ads-G5> there's 5 volts
[GMT 12/17/05 16:51:49] <ads-G5> also, aeros is running very slow for some reason
[GMT 12/17/05 16:52:01] <ads-G5> constipated
[GMT 12/17/05 16:52:08] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> How many minutes of 500Hz data are you displaying?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:52:28] <ads-G5> 20 mins
[GMT 12/17/05 16:52:40] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> back it off to 2
[GMT 12/17/05 16:54:25] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> well, there are less spikes at 5 volts....but still not clean.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:55:05] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Do we know for sure that that decade box is good?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:55:39] <ads-G5> easier said than done
[GMT 12/17/05 16:55:49] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> understood.
[GMT 12/17/05 16:56:00] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> how about the other one?
[GMT 12/17/05 16:56:10] <ads-G5> we are using volts not the decade box
[GMT 12/17/05 16:56:17] <ads-G5> we can checl it though
[GMT 12/17/05 16:56:37] <ads-G5> the spikes at 5 are all downward
[GMT 12/17/05 16:57:00] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> yup
[GMT 12/17/05 16:58:33] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> what's the difference between the Vdc source and the decade box?

[GMT 12/17/05 17:05:18] <ads-G5> decade box is resistance
[GMT 12/17/05 17:05:40] <ads-G5> chris we are seeing fine plots in degrees c
[GMT 12/17/05 17:06:22] <ads-G5> everyone here is in agreement that it is software induced
[GMT 12/17/05 17:06:38] <ads-G5> what's the deal
[GMT 12/17/05 17:12:41] <ads-G5> same sampling error we saw in flight
[GMT 12/17/05 17:13:06] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> You are seeing fine plots in degC, because that is 500 samples averaged down to 1.  If there aren't many spikes, then it looks good.
[GMT 12/17/05 17:13:34] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> We'll never take a good cal with this, unless I remove the spikes in the cal program.
[GMT 12/17/05 17:13:46] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Which is not going to happen today.
[GMT 12/17/05 17:14:35] <ads-G5> well, we narrowed the plot time looking atr deg c and we are seeing some small spikes
[GMT 12/17/05 17:15:00] <ads-G5> cycled power on dsm and they are still there
[GMT 12/17/05 17:20:36] <ads-G5> we are seeing the sampling jitter, is this from fifo that Gordon had described
[GMT 12/17/05 17:21:51] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> not sure.  he's about to call me.
[GMT 12/17/05 17:24:16] <ads-G5> i think everyone has given up here.  we will just leave it alone for the flight on monday and figure it out afterward
[GMT 12/17/05 17:26:57] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> 10-4/I agree.
