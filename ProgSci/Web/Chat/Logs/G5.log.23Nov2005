[GMT 11/23/05 00:00:35] <JeffStith-JeffCo> Hello Chris,
[GMT 11/23/05 00:00:39] <JeffStith-JeffCo> anybody listening?
[GMT 11/23/05 00:01:18] <ChrisWebster-GV> Hi Jeff

[GMT 11/23/05 00:02:25] <ChrisWebster-GV> EMI ground passed.  We are now doing EMI in the air.

[GMT 11/23/05 00:13:19] <AlCooper> hi jeff -- going pretty well up here, I think. EMI test OK
[GMT 11/23/05 00:13:55] <JeffStith-JeffCo> OK we are monitoring chat hear awaiting occasional updates on what's going on
[GMT 11/23/05 00:14:20] <JeffStith-JeffCo> here
[GMT 11/23/05 00:14:38] <AlCooper> I'll be mostly off of chat, trying to review variables as fast as I can. Not much to report for problems yet.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:15:20] <JeffStith-JeffCo> OK.  Sometime later in the flight just let Jorgen and me know what's up
[GMT 11/23/05 00:15:50] <ChrisWebster-GV> Getting first and only sone in launch tube now
[GMT 11/23/05 00:16:08] <JeffStith-JeffCo> ohboy
[GMT 11/23/05 00:16:24] <ChrisWebster-GV> going to cycle launch tube opener first, before applying sone

[GMT 11/23/05 00:37:13] <AlCooper> looking quite good here. Successful sonde, with good data. TDL working (although not to data system). DPs look reasonable. One T looks right; other about 10deg too warm.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:38:01] <AlCooper> winds seem OK (exc for offset in WI and influence of climb  -- reflecting uncalibrated radome). GS good as compared IRS and GPS. 
[GMT 11/23/05 00:38:23] <AlCooper> Only one IRS recording properly -- maybe something I don't understand there.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:38:43] <AlCooper> Teresa says there was some problem with gases with CO, but instrument seems to be working OK.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:39:22] <AlCooper> correction: that comment on TDL was that mixing ratio not available to the data system, so I can't tell if the measurements are reasonable. 
[GMT 11/23/05 00:40:13] <AlCooper> dew points have large regular spikes as recorded from serial output, but look good as recorded from analog.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:41:02] <AlCooper> Dave's RDMA working, and CN counters working (but some problems with intermittent-zeros in recorded output)

[GMT 11/23/05 00:44:46] <AlCooper> now at 20kft. T=-25, consistent with DEN sounding before we took off. DP==35, also right on sounding
[GMT 11/23/05 00:45:28] <JeffStith-JeffCo> Al, Jorgen and I thank you for the update, sounds pretty good overall
[GMT 11/23/05 00:46:06] <AlCooper> wind also consistent with what we expected from KDNR sounding

[GMT 11/23/05 00:48:17] <JeffStith-JeffCo> Bill, how are things from your/Kurt's perspective?
[GMT 11/23/05 00:48:36] <AlCooper> ozone instrument doesn't provide us anything to check, except a green light, so Teresa can't tell if it's working or not. No problems as far as she can tell.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:49:11] <AlCooper> CO will need some attention from Teresa after the flight. She thinks a flow restrictor will be needed.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:50:03] <AlCooper> Have now released 3 sondes, two successfully. 3rd had some failure not linked to release, as far as we know; maybe parachute problem?
[GMT 11/23/05 00:51:04] <BillIrwin-GV> Instrument dump pressures look ok to Dave R., temps are not matching very well, dew points match, but one seems to have occasional jump
[GMT 11/23/05 00:51:43] <BillIrwin-GV> temps track well, two match perfectly, one is -10 degrees from two that match, other is 5 degree's hotter than two that match
[GMT 11/23/05 00:52:19] <TeresaCampos-g5> If you all want to compare the raw TDL signal to the dewpointers, look at pp2f_lhl and pp2f_lhs.
[GMT 11/23/05 00:52:38] <BillIrwin-GV> sonde launch sequence worked fairly well at low altitudes, door doesn't latch well in back to baggage compartment
[GMT 11/23/05 00:53:09] <TeresaCampos-g5> pp2f_lhl refers to the multipass channel, and pp2f_lhs is for the short path channel (troposph. levels)
[GMT 11/23/05 00:55:01] <BillIrwin-GV> too many new variables don't have single line descriptions next to the list that we get from Aero's for display purposes, too hard to figure out what's what
[GMT 11/23/05 01:00:25] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Thanks everybody, sounds great - congratulations to everybody in air and on the ground!
[GMT 11/23/05 01:00:36] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Hi AL,
[GMT 11/23/05 01:00:48] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Bob Olsen was asking gfor an estimated touchdown?
[GMT 11/23/05 01:02:00] <BillIrwin-GV> landing time approx. 7 pm, another hour or so
[GMT 11/23/05 01:03:36] <AlCooper> now that we're climbing to 30kft, the cabin is getting pretty noisy. I'm not sure the source, maybe inlets and TDL? 
[GMT 11/23/05 01:04:06] <JeffStith-JeffCo> I wonder if there is noise from the rake?
[GMT 11/23/05 01:04:32] <AlCooper> might be. I'll try to see where it is, esp. if it gets worse as we go higher.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:07:32] <AlCooper> some update on the temperatures: Of the four, ATX looks right to me, the other 3 are clearly off, by more than 10C. ATX is ATLH2. At 30Kft, T=-48, still pretty good vs KDNR sounding

[GMT 11/23/05 01:12:23] <AlCooper-GV> we have had DMS crashes, apparently associated with the pressure rake. Trying to restart DSMs now. 
[GMT 11/23/05 01:13:35] <AlCooper-GV> In response to Chris's question, I said it's more important to get the DSM questions resolved that to try to continue to collect data. (We could proceed with part of the DSMs.) He's working on it.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:14:20] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Al, My understanding is that the temperature sensors still need bath calibrations; some were initially done, but I seem to remember that they needed redoing. I am not sure about the problem; maybe Bill knows better.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:16:06] <AlCooper-GV> yes, he says that bath cals are needed. At least they seem to be tracking well.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:17:02] <JeffStith-JeffCo> how is the noise level? Any ideas on that?
[GMT 11/23/05 01:18:12] <TeresaCampos-g5> It seems that the loudest is the optical viewport.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:18:48] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Hi, This is Shan-hu, How are you everyone?  and how are you Sumizah --someone please ask her!
[GMT 11/23/05 01:19:46] <TeresaCampos-g5> I am bored
[GMT 11/23/05 01:20:09] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> that's good news!!  did you finish reading the paper ?
[GMT 11/23/05 01:20:30] <TeresaCampos-g5> Hi Shanhu I am using teresas log in to chat
[GMT 11/23/05 01:20:48] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> i know... how are things there
[GMT 11/23/05 01:21:17] <TeresaCampos-g5> Yes Not much for me to do but others are having problems
[GMT 11/23/05 01:22:03] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> OK,,, i have to go,,, Jensen wants me to get off here,,, see you soon!! 
[GMT 11/23/05 01:22:14] <TeresaCampos-g5> Bye
[GMT 11/23/05 01:23:49] <BillIrwin-GV> jorgen, note, at higher altitudes, release valve on sonde drop tube (handle in baggage compartment) "sings" very loud, until re-cocked after sonde drop, air is
[GMT 11/23/05 01:24:13] <BillIrwin-GV> vibrating the door that allows sonde to drop
[GMT 11/23/05 01:25:40] <BillIrwin-GV> all temp sensors on GV were bath cal'd, and at first look, seemed ok, they all do track well, but some are offset from each other...hey one out of 4 ain't bad....yeeech
[GMT 11/23/05 01:28:52] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Hmmm, OK. Let's discuss on the ground
[GMT 11/23/05 01:29:43] <AlCooper-GV> -70C at 40Kft, just at the tropopause, I think. (Lost my sounding in a display-system crash, but it got really smooth here.)
[GMT 11/23/05 01:31:11] <AlCooper-GV> Teresa's right, the sound I was hearing is mostly the forward optical port. I'm right underneath it, so it's really bothersome without earplugs. Recommend them. (I have them.)
[GMT 11/23/05 01:32:50] Nick change: TeresaCampos-g5 -> DaveR-g5
[GMT 11/23/05 01:40:37] <AlCooper-GV> now climbing, at 46Kft. Clearly in the stratosphere now. Wish we could see the O3 values. We have mostly reset, including the TDL but not CN or pressure-rake.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:43:52] <AlCooper-GV> My own sense, as of now, is that it would be worthwhile to try the planned flight tomorrow, but we have some issues to talk about. We don't really understand what led to the system crash, so that's a worry. If it's associated with the pressure rack / CN in some way, as Chris seems to think, it might be worthwhile to fly a start mission keeping them off?
[GMT 11/23/05 01:45:03] <AlCooper-GV> Chris will use the flight back (starting in about 10 min) to try to understand the problems better.
[GMT 11/23/05 01:47:15] <AlCooper-GV> (We're really far into the stratosphere here at 47Kft -- what fun!)
[GMT 11/23/05 02:03:57] <AlCooper-GV> we're about 20 min out, pilots estimate.
[GMT 11/23/05 02:14:22] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Hi Al,
[GMT 11/23/05 02:14:36] <ChrisWebster-GV> landing in 3
[GMT 11/23/05 02:14:46] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> We are all waiting on the ground, and I was away from the desk. How many more minutes to touchdown?
