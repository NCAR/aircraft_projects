[GMT 12/19/05 13:55:01] <DaveR-Jeffco> Riverton, WY sounding this morning shows trop ~300 mb, 30kft, temp -49C
[GMT 12/19/05 13:59:30] <AlCooper-G5> Thanks, Dave, we just climbed and confirmed that.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:00:12] <AlCooper-G5> Can you check GGW for us?
[GMT 12/19/05 14:00:57] <DaveR-Jeffco> Al- maybe I should put my wx & flt comments on this channel. I just put another comment on &G5, but will be more selective from here on.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:01:02] <DaveR-Jeffco> Yes, I'll get GGW.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:01:08] <shanhu-g5> Thanks dave, that's wonderful!!!  How about 53W 114W
[GMT 12/19/05 14:01:24] <shanhu-g5> 48N 1113w
[GMT 12/19/05 14:01:51] <shanhu-g5>  43n 108w

[GMT 12/19/05 14:02:38] <DaveR-Jeffco> Noticed CN peak during your climb, while in stratosphere. Pieces of it are showing up during descent too.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:04:32] <shanhu-g5> Dave,
[GMT 12/19/05 14:04:52] <shanhu-g5> we were supposed to be in dark but see the outside -- what a depressing twilight!!
[GMT 12/19/05 14:06:36] <DaveR-Jeffco> GGW 12z is stable above 600 mb = 14kft.  Temp sounding goes isothermal -60C above 220mb = 37kft.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:07:21] <shanhu-g5> what lat is for ggw??
[GMT 12/19/05 14:07:26] <DaveR-Jeffco> And in the region 600mb to 220mb, there are easterly winds. Max wind speed 45kt at 230mb.
[GMT 12/19/05 14:08:43] <DaveR-Jeffco> GGW is Glasgow, Montana. Lat 48.20N, Lon 106.61w
[GMT 12/19/05 14:10:05] <shanhu-g5> dave,
[GMT 12/19/05 14:10:09] <shanhu-g5> thanks
[GMT 12/19/05 14:10:45] <shanhu-g5> what about other latitudes... the troppopause in ggw is much higher than the prediction

[GMT 12/19/05 14:14:01] <shanhu-g5> Good morning Chuck, instruments are good here... However, we are looking at twilight here... very depressing light
[GMT 12/19/05 14:28:13] <DaveR-Jeffco> Dew pointers seem to be working, but show none of the fine structure that TDL shows.

[GMT 12/19/05 15:17:47] <DaveR-Jeffco> Great Falls, MT, sounding 12z shows low tropopause, 400mb ~23kft -37C light easterly winds. Humidity ~30 to 40% from there and higher altitudes.

[GMT 12/19/05 15:23:55] <AlCooper-G5> Thanks, Dave, I think were back solidly in the troposphere now but were marginal for times there in Montana. The humidity wasn't as low as strat values (if I can interpret the TDL counts right) but was still very low. If you have a chance to look at the Canadian sounding at CWSE, that would be very interesting to us now.

[GMT 12/19/05 15:25:45] <DaveR-Jeffco> CN spike at 15:25 looks like you crossed aircraft exhaust trail. 
[GMT 12/19/05 15:27:05] <AlCooper-G5> I wondered what that was. The CN counts seem reasonable to me, and the difference between strat. and trop. is very interesting.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:28:24] <DaveR-Jeffco> Edmonton, Alberta, sounding has trop at 200mb = 38.4kft, -68C, winds westerly ~10kt.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:33:05] <shanhu-g5> DaveR - thank you!
[GMT 12/19/05 15:35:14] <shanhu-g5> Dave look at my previous requests in G5 too.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:42:55] <DaveR-Jeffco> Fort Smith (YSM) 60.0N, -112W 12z sounding has top 330mb = 27.6kft -50C, winds NW 65kt and 60%rh.
[GMT 12/19/05 15:44:28] <shanhu-g5> DaveR -- thank you so much!! those are very helpful!
[GMT 12/19/05 15:45:40] <DaveR-Jeffco> Shan-Hu - these values are from existing rawinsonde stations. There are no stations at the other lat/lon positions that you asked about.

[GMT 12/19/05 16:19:20] <shanhu-g5> DaveR, we just are going down to 22 kft, and saw that WCPC going up high (>2,500) with RH increasing; NMASS counts are also going up too..  We should do intercomparison paper for this,,,
[GMT 12/19/05 16:33:38] <DaveR-> Shan-Hu, sounds good. Thanks for update.
