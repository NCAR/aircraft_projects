[GMT 12/07/05 15:52:24] <ads-G5> There were a bunch of Dec 2 files there.  Looks like they're being overwritten.
[GMT 12/07/05 15:52:47] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> you can remove them.  Do you have time to restart nimbus again?
[GMT 12/07/05 15:53:00] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> the launch_script should have removed them?
[GMT 12/07/05 15:53:01] <ads-G5> yes
[GMT 12/07/05 15:53:14] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Did you use script or just nimbus -rt3 -x

[GMT 12/07/05 15:53:55] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ok, which uses script.  Wonder why files didn't get removed...
[GMT 12/07/05 15:54:15] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> you could cat /home/local/src/nimbus/scripts/launch_nimbus_rt and hand run the few commands.
[GMT 12/07/05 15:55:33] <ads-G5> I nuked the files and restarted nimbus

[GMT 12/07/05 17:11:53] <stith> the wind has been p;retty steady ranging from 305/32 ms to 324/38
[GMT 12/07/05 17:12:06] <stith> the main core of the jet may still be above us
[GMT 12/07/05 17:12:48] <stith> there is still quite a variation in the temps, but they all wiggle the same
[GMT 12/07/05 17:13:11] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> The front right laptio did quite aeros a few times during Shan-hu's flight; my impression was that it was when she changed the time intervals to display. The software is still in development, so it is not surprising that there may be problems on occasion. If Gordon Maclean (onboard) can help you [provided he has no other issues], then feel free to ask him.

[GMT 12/07/05 17:13:46] <DaveRogers-Jeffco> Laura- Are you using MS-Windows laptop? The MS-Windows version of aeros will crash if the first plot variable has missing values. Suggest trying to display ASCII variables first (crash-free).
[GMT 12/07/05 17:14:20] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> jeff, Al Schanot implemeted the new temperature calibrations on the ground, and here the temperatures from RF02 was within 0.37 degrees mean for the entire flight. maybe we still need to implement these calibrations in the air.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:14:34] <Teresa-GV> Cliff, Hal is working very well.  so far I haven't had to increase the restriction in the inlet line.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:14:56] <Teresa-GV> We're not all that high up yet, though.

[GMT 12/07/05 17:22:19] <DaveRogers-Jeffco> Laura- you might check that the time period is not too long. Uncheck "start at earliest data time", select "end at latest data time", and choose duration of about 00:15.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:23:07] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I'm here.

[GMT 12/07/05 17:32:13] <DaveRogers-Jeffco> Ta, Bill- chilled mirror dewpoints show missing values about every 15 seconds. Both sensors (DPLS, DPRS) drop out at about the same time.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:32:43] <shanhu_jeffco> Hi Gordon, how are you?? 
[GMT 12/07/05 17:33:00] <schanot_jeffco> Gordon: look in the DependTable at the input variable.  it should be DPLC and the dependency for DPLC should be DPLS.  my guess is that you will find either DPL or DPR which have been removed.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:33:09] <GordonMaclean-GV> Dropouts on DPLS/DPRS are to be expected.  They report a little slower than 1/sec, so we
[GMT 12/07/05 17:33:09] <billirwin-GV> yes dave we know, they are oversamped according to gordon, and sometimes there is no data available yet for ads III to digest yet
[GMT 12/07/05 17:33:11] <GordonMaclean-GV> see the dropouts.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:33:32] <GordonMaclean-GV> Actually undersampled  - they report at about 0.9samples/sec

[GMT 12/07/05 17:47:58] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Gordon, there have been issues where it "core dumps" when calling up time series, we suspect if the initial values are missing_values is when it happens.
[GMT 12/07/05 17:51:59] <GordonMaclean-GV> Yes, it would die on her every time she tried to display a humidity.

[GMT 12/07/05 18:16:44] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> jeffs the color is Ambient Temp.  I think you can goto the Edit menu, Change Variables, and replace Temperature with something else. 
[GMT 12/07/05 18:17:25] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> jeffs I just tested this and it works, but, the color scale is set for Temp, so when I changed it to WS I got all white.
[GMT 12/07/05 18:18:09] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> GordonMaclean-GV I found a manual, I don't see anything in her about being able to send any commands to it.  It does say the software is upgradable by the end user.
[GMT 12/07/05 18:18:34] <jeffs> problem is the thing froze on me, not updating, so may need to restart
[GMT 12/07/05 18:18:39] <GordonMaclean-GV> No commands available over the RS2323?
[GMT 12/07/05 18:18:47] <GordonMaclean-GV> RS232
[GMT 12/07/05 18:19:52] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> none that I've found.
[GMT 12/07/05 18:22:23] <GordonMaclean-GV> OK, thanks.
[GMT 12/07/05 18:23:08] <GordonMaclean-GV> Is there a quick way to cut/paste someone's nick name into a message?
[GMT 12/07/05 18:25:08] <GordonMaclean-GV> How about replacing XP with linux on the front RHS laptop before the next flight?

[GMT 12/07/05 18:26:34] <KenBowman-TAMU> Hi everyone.  FYI, the internet access to real-time data seems to be partly working.  The flight-track plot is better than the data plots.

[GMT 12/07/05 18:47:37] <billirwin-GV> the 4 laptops, 3 linux and 1 windows are all the same, trays are also, so we can swap out an entire tray, or just swap out laptop with the 3rd linux machine

[GMT 12/07/05 19:12:21] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> MS Streets & Trips is being deceived in that it thinks it's connected to a handheld GPS when it's actually connected to the aircraft data stream that I have re-formatted into standard NMEA GPS sentences.  To make it work, you must enter my AVAPS Utilities to get my software to read the acft data and rebroadcast it to the S & T input serial port.  Here's the procedure: 1) Open 'AVAPS Drop' application (icon on desktop next to Streets & Trips)  
[GMT 12/07/05 19:13:00] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> 2) click 'Utilities'  3) click 'Hardware Tests'  4) click 'Test Aircraft Data System'.  You should now see the current aircraft data being displayed in the utility.  5) go to MS S & T and click 'Start GPS Tracking'

[GMT 12/07/05 19:23:53] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Steve- the AVAPS computer clock must be set to within a second or two of the ADADS aircraft data time, and maybe it has drifted since last use. Try setting it to the GMT time and see if that helps.  It might be best to close AVAPS before setting the clock...
[GMT 12/07/05 19:25:31] <GordonMaclean-GV> For rf04:  we need to fix the problem of no RH or corrected DP on the aeros displays.
[GMT 12/07/05 19:26:21] <GordonMaclean-GV> Possible solutions that I see:  sample DP again with A2D (500samples/sec).  
[GMT 12/07/05 19:27:32] <GordonMaclean-GV> Or fix problem where derived variables are missing if dropouts occur in DPLS or DPRS.
[GMT 12/07/05 19:28:07] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Steve- have you turned on the power to the AVAPS data system (big toggle switch on the fan panel)?  I think it isn't necessary but can't be sure from here.

[GMT 12/07/05 19:44:09] <stever-GV> Dean - tried all that. Apparently, can't get clock close enough. Oh, well, it was just something to do to fill in time....
[GMT 12/07/05 19:44:46] <DaveRogers-Jeffco> Steve- did you get a good video of sonde eject test? Are you going to do several tests?
[GMT 12/07/05 19:47:19] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Steve- if it's still not finding the ADADS data after setting the pc clock to GMT, try this -- On the AVAPS Aircraft Display utility, clcik on the the smode selector that currently says "Display: Time Selected Aircraft Data String" and change it to "Dispaly: Raw Aircraft Data String (direct from hardware interface" and let me know if the raw data now appears in the windows below the selector.  Note: the parsed data display box on the right sid

[GMT 12/07/05 19:50:51] <stever-GV> Dean - I took three on the ground, and then did three more about a half hour ago. We're at about FL400 now so I think I'll go try three more, as well as check on the "noise." I did notice a leak around the extension tube where it penetrates the launcher, but that's downstream of the valve plate and shouldn't be contributing to what you noticed....
[GMT 12/07/05 19:51:28] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Steve- in the "Display Raw Data..." if you don't see the raw data from ADADS, ask one of the RAF techs to confirms that they are actually broadcasting the data to AVAPS.

[GMT 12/07/05 20:10:31] <billirwin-GV> we believe that MPDB dsm sometimes loses adc data (connection problems?)
[GMT 12/07/05 20:14:51] <allbee_Jeffco> Bill, Do you get DPL and DPR in your list of variables?  Here we get DPLS and DPLR.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:15:08] <allbee_Jeffco> DPRS not DPLR
[GMT 12/07/05 20:16:29] <GordonMaclean-GV> We're not sampling the dew pointers through the A2D, so we only have DPLS,DPRS
[GMT 12/07/05 20:17:30] <allbee_Jeffco> What happened to the analog dew point signals?
[GMT 12/07/05 20:17:32] <GordonMaclean-GV> It would be really nice if we could get them to report faster than 1 sample/sec though.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:18:50] <GordonMaclean-GV> We decided to remove them from the data config - with Al Schanot's agreement.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:21:36] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill and Gordon, I am making up a replacement cable this afternoon for that DSM.  We were going to install it on Saturday but we might be able to do it tonight if it is an issue.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:22:03] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill, we just found 3 Gray boxes from Greenland.  Can you guess what is in them?
[GMT 12/07/05 20:22:57] <billirwin-GV> dew pointers are no longer analog channels on the GV, they are serial signals.....WHAT WHERE DID THESE BOXES COME FROM, WHERE HAVE THEY BEEN HIDING ALL THIS TIME
[GMT 12/07/05 20:24:00] <Jcowan-Jeffco> There are still analog dew point signals, DPT and DPL.  They are not used in the depend table though.  If the serial dropouts are an issue then maybe they need to be switched back.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:24:49] <Jcowan-Jeffco> On the boxes, they have Cantrell's name on them.  We are not sure where they came from Kip just noticed them in the hanger.  All the missing cords appear to be there.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:25:24] <billirwin-GV> that is truly something to behold, i wonder where they've been all this time
[GMT 12/07/05 20:25:56] <Jcowan-Jeffco> So do the rest of us.  If they could only tell thier story <grin>.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:27:19] <billirwin-GV> So John, would it be 'easier" to add the analog dew pointers back into the software package, or do we want to change out the cable inside the dsm....
[GMT 12/07/05 20:28:16] <billirwin-GV> the analog signal from the dew pointers is not a true analog, it is a converted digital signal...
[GMT 12/07/05 20:28:20] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I believe serial dropouts are a problem in real-time and we don't see them in post-processing.  I'll need to verify that.  So I think it has something to do with Gordon's timeout for sorting data.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:28:24] <CliffHeizer-Jeffco> Teresa,  You wanted the larger cylinders of CO2 CAL gasses so they could be used to fill the 1.0 liter modules, correct??
[GMT 12/07/05 20:28:57] <billirwin-GV> ahh so, ok that would be cool
[GMT 12/07/05 20:29:30] <billirwin-GV> but what caused the long drop out today?
[GMT 12/07/05 20:29:40] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> heavy gravity.

[GMT 12/07/05 20:36:21] <GordonMaclean-GV> Chris, do you know why a roughly 1 out of 10 dropout in DPLS & DPLS kills RHUM ?
[GMT 12/07/05 20:37:40] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I have not heard what the plan for tomorrow is.  I think it might be a flight north though.

[GMT 12/07/05 20:39:40] <GordonMaclean-GV> Chris: I don't think it is a sorting problem.  The deltaT is consistantly 1.09 sec, so about 1 out of 10

[GMT 12/07/05 20:54:08] <schanot_jeffco> No.  You need a "corrected" dewpoint - DPLC or DPRC.  The raw outputs from DPLS and DPRS and DPR and DPL are all "frostpoints" at these levels.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:55:01] <schanot_jeffco> When we look at the variable list onboard right now, neither DPLC nor DPRC show up in the list.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:55:25] <GordonMaclean-GV> How do we add it?
[GMT 12/07/05 20:56:46] <schanot_jeffco> That's one for Chris.  We don't I don't know why it is gone.  It was there on the previous flight.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:58:19] <GordonMaclean-GV> Perhaps I was looking in the wrong DependTable.  I now see that DPRC is computed from DPR and
[GMT 12/07/05 20:58:31] <GordonMaclean-GV> not DPRS.  I can change that.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:59:20] <schanot_jeffco> Give it a try, but I think you'll have to restart nimbus to activate it.  I don't think they want the data gap.
[GMT 12/07/05 20:59:57] <GordonMaclean-GV> Someone should ask Chris: would it cause LDM problems?  
[GMT 12/07/05 21:00:25] <GordonMaclean-GV> It wouldn't cause a dropout in the raw data.
[GMT 12/07/05 21:00:31] <schanot_jeffco> There are two directories with this information.  One is a general "default" version and the other is the project (502) specific version.  It is the later one that counts.

[GMT 12/07/05 21:17:44] <CliffHeizer-Jeffco> The CO2 CAL gasses (two each of 4 concentrations, AL size) will need to be gravimetrically mixed and they will fill two cylinders simultaneously and adjust one if necessary to get them the same concentration to the degree possible.  They will analyze.  I am awaiting the quote now.  They say they can meet Jan 9th deadline.
[GMT 12/07/05 21:20:31] <TCampos__GV> Dean - waiting again to go to a high altitude for another tape session....but re-playing what I have, I can't see much change in valve opening time. One thing I did notice was the amount of "shakin' & jivin'" from the launcher was significantly less at altitude than it was on the ground - which would indicate to me that the valve plate is not hitting the stops as hard - that is, opening slower.

[GMT 12/07/05 21:36:00] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Steve-what was the highest altitude that you cycled the launcher?  Any joy on getting the S & T maps going, if not, was the raw data showing in the utility when you switched display modes to 'raw data'?
[GMT 12/07/05 21:38:06] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Gordon, does DPRC depend on DPRS or DPR ?

[GMT 12/07/05 21:41:22] <schanot_jeffco> You are correct.  We still have IRS ground speeds so post flight data will be OK.
[GMT 12/07/05 21:42:12] <schanot_jeffco> Looks like you may have to alter the DependTable any way to get the winds back on line.  Any chance of arinc - GPS coming back?

[GMT 12/07/05 21:46:25] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Steve- check with Bill when he has a spare moment to see if he can confirm that the ADADS program that broadcast UDP data to AVAPS is running.  I suspect it is not, otherwise it would show in my acft data display utility.  When my utility is in 'raw' display mode, it's doing nothing to the incoming data stream but displaying it, so it should be there if ADADS is broadcasting it.
[GMT 12/07/05 21:46:28] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> RHUM also relies on ATX which relies on arinc-gps AT_A
[GMT 12/07/05 21:46:54] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> no data is lost if we restart nimbus, but we would loose the ground data for a while.

[GMT 12/07/05 22:37:04] <CliffHeizer_Jeffco> Hi Teresa,  Andy will take tomorrows flight and I will take Friday's.  I will be here at 0800 hrs to get things started.  It might be wise to come in a bit before door close to go over bugs and/or new discoveries before take off.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:37:51] <JohnWasinger-GV> arinc sensor underflow measures the number of times a read fails to gather any data.  One count per poll at 4Hz.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:40:37] <JohnWasinger-GV> tried swapping the arinc GPS from port 1 to port 2...  no joy
[GMT 12/07/05 22:42:54] <GordonMaclean-GV> Chris: FYI I wrote a script to dump the ads feed: ~/ads/scripts/tcpdump_ads_feed.sh
[GMT 12/07/05 22:44:21] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ok
[GMT 12/07/05 22:46:21] <DeanLauritsen-FL1> Gordon- nope on the NaN's when in raw display mode -- I'm not parsing anything at that point, just displaying the raw chars as they come off the interface.  Does Windows show an IP connection icon in the lower right section of the tray when it's using UDP?  Can't recall seeing it...
[GMT 12/07/05 22:46:35] Nick change: AvapsOps -> Teresa-GV
[GMT 12/07/05 22:47:25] <Teresa-GV> Hi Cliff. Thanks for the news.  I'll try to get a procedure sheet (short) ready for Andy so he will feel comfortable.  If it's a low alt mission, things should be very easy, knock wood.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:48:12] <Teresa-GV> I'll also try to get in by 0800 (or 0830) to go over things with Andy.  Any ideas on which flight mission is favored for Friday at this point?
[GMT 12/07/05 22:49:44] <Teresa-GV> Cliff, one thing on our to do list after today's flight.  Let's try to do a quick cal of Hal (with our primary standard) before (or just after) Friday's flight.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:50:13] <Teresa-GV> Otherwise we'll have to be here at least briefly on Saturday to do that. Icky either way, pretty much.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:50:29] <JohnWasinger-GV> JOY on arinc GPS!
[GMT 12/07/05 22:50:55] Nick change: Teresa-GV -> Bill-GV
[GMT 12/07/05 22:51:30] <JohnWasinger-GV> Bill noticed that the male connector pins seamed to be recessed too far...  
[GMT 12/07/05 22:52:15] <Jcowan-Jeffco> John did he do anything to the pins?
[GMT 12/07/05 22:52:59] <Bill-GV> ok, this is what i did, top connector out of MPDB which is the GPS connector, unplugged it, saw inside the male connector pins are recessed VERY deep, plugged it back in, and bingo it works now, those pins are not making consistant connections
[GMT 12/07/05 22:54:11] <Bill-GV> don't know for sure if the pins are slipping deeper into the back shell, or if female end doesn't make consistant connections to them, but i think that's the center of the problem
[GMT 12/07/05 22:54:29] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill, didn't John try swpapping connectors before?
[GMT 12/07/05 22:55:16] <Bill-GV> he said he messed with it some, as Gordon said, he's software, Bill's a tech....I DUNNO
[GMT 12/07/05 22:56:27] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bill I really thing it is the connector in the DSM.  I tried to recycle the DB connector and I wonder if those are the pines that are messing up.. We have not seen except after I worked on that DSM.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:56:28] <JohnWasinger-GV> I tried to gently wiggle the plug while twisted part-way in...
[GMT 12/07/05 22:56:46] <CliffHeizer_Jeffco> Teresa, sounds good to me.  I heard chance of stratocumulus 75%, particle 25%.  Only thing is, I don't know where I heard the numbers so I could be all wet.  We'll know tomorrow!
[GMT 12/07/05 22:57:05] <shanhu_jeffco> From Henry:  we will very likely go for northern flight tomorrow.
[GMT 12/07/05 22:57:25] <laptop4-g5> from stith eta is 1730 local, pending major science encounters
[GMT 12/07/05 22:57:34] <CliffHeizer_Jeffco> Teresa, see? I told you!
[GMT 12/07/05 22:57:55] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Teresa, is it correct that you can use then 10 minutes of power on in Hangar, not on the ramp?
[GMT 12/07/05 22:59:25] <laptop4-g5> windows aeros still hanging
[GMT 12/07/05 22:59:37] <Bill-GV> Jorgen, can she use the time that we're on the ramp for diff. GPS to download data?

[GMT 12/07/05 23:03:00] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> She is on the aircraft; can you ask her?
[GMT 12/07/05 23:04:29] <Teresa_GV> Jorgen, I think I can even do the download during the taxi.  I had thought that I had to run to the back of the rack to swap disks, but not necessary now.  I can do the whole thing during taxi, without unbuckling my seat belt.
[GMT 12/07/05 23:04:45] <Teresa_GV> That is, if I can reach the keyboard :-)

[GMT 12/07/05 23:09:51] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Chris, If you are to do the software swap tonight, how much time with power on do you need?
[GMT 12/07/05 23:10:16] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Or laternatively, can you do it tomorrow, given a 10AM takeoff?

[GMT 12/07/05 23:23:13] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> JohnWasinger-GV I think the .00098 means you opened some high-rate file.  Stick to the ground/onboard
