[GMT 01/13/06 19:53:59] <ads-G5> I was just making sure that it worked.

[GMT 01/13/06 19:58:29] <laptop4-g5> hi mike, glad to see some interest
[GMT 01/13/06 19:59:38] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> are you airborne?
[GMT 01/13/06 19:59:56] <laptop4-g5> taxi now
[GMT 01/13/06 20:00:02] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> ok, thx
[GMT 01/13/06 20:02:03] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> do you know if a google maps display will be available for this afternoon's flight?
[GMT 01/13/06 20:02:30] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> i'm in the exernal advisory committee meeting and i thought it might be nice to show this during the break at 245P
[GMT 01/13/06 20:02:32] <laptop4-g5> can't say for sure, but i think so
[GMT 01/13/06 20:02:37] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> OK
[GMT 01/13/06 20:03:38] <laptop4-g5> in the air
[GMT 01/13/06 20:07:39] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> are you calling this flight rf15?
[GMT 01/13/06 20:11:44] <laptop4-g5> yes

[GMT 01/13/06 20:12:43] <pavel-jeffco> Hi Al. I will call Stuart to tell you're inbound.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:18:05] <laptop4-g5> preparing to start low passes at Ft Morgan
[GMT 01/13/06 20:33:08] <pavel-jeffco> I called Stuart to tell him that the airplane he is watching is the GV.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:33:23] <pavel-jeffco> He sort of figured out as much by then.

[GMT 01/13/06 20:35:56] <wasinger> topic is "hi john"  ???
[GMT 01/13/06 20:36:41] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> i don't have google maps on my laptop, anybody else?  
[GMT 01/13/06 20:37:10] <pavel-jeffco> No. The program needs to be started manually. And I don't know what the program is.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:38:21] <wasinger> MikeDaniels-NCAR, Chris is out today... he didn't leave any start up instructions for the KLM
[GMT 01/13/06 20:38:47] <pavel-jeffco> I tried to call him againg, he's not answering.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:39:09] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> do gordon or janet know how to start it?
[GMT 01/13/06 20:39:30] <pavel-jeffco> I doubt it. GE was Chris' toy. This is not really critical, I will get the startup instructions from him.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:40:11] <pavel-jeffco> However, maybe John can look in that bin directory? Perhaps the name is self explanatory?
[GMT 01/13/06 20:40:15] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> ok, again, i was just hoping to demonstrate it during the exteral advisory meeting (break at 245p)...
[GMT 01/13/06 20:40:31] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> but, if not, i will just use a prior flight
[GMT 01/13/06 20:40:36] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> thx for the info
[GMT 01/13/06 20:41:12] <wasinger> MikeDaniels-NCAR, hyper:/bin ?
[GMT 01/13/06 20:44:04] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> john, i am sitting here in a discussion and won't be able to check - sorry.  i also will be giving my presentation from 205p-245p
[GMT 01/13/06 20:47:18] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> i'm going to email janet
[GMT 01/13/06 20:49:20] <pavel-jeffco> I called Janet, she is starting it up now.

[GMT 01/13/06 20:51:58] <pavel-jeffco> Janet - Mike sait he is giving a talk at 14:05, he might be off chat for a bit. But he will try to get RT track.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:54:59] <JanetScannell-fl> Pavel - I started the process to update the flight map.  Let me know if it is working.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:55:49] <laptop4-g5> finished at Ft Morgan
[GMT 01/13/06 20:55:58] <laptop4-g5> climbing to 10K ft
[GMT 01/13/06 20:58:38] <pavel-jeffco> I don't think it is working. Probably too late for Mike anyway, but he really gave us a little to short a warning.
[GMT 01/13/06 20:59:56] <JanetScannell-fl> I just restarted the ldm on malbec, so the data is starting to come in.  Should be updating shortly.

[GMT 01/13/06 21:06:07] <laptop4-g5> keyboard on ads just died again
[GMT 01/13/06 21:06:50] <pavel-jeffco> Great. The mouse usually dies about 2 hrs later, so should last through the flight.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:07:44] <pavel-jeffco> Strangely enough, NumLock and CapsLoc seem to work on the kbd, so I wonder if it is a drivers issue.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:11:25] <pavel-jeffco> Janet - seems we still get no data, including aeros.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:14:42] <JanetScannell-fl> For some reason, Chris' programs that put the ldm data into the database are not working.  The database still has old data in it, but the new data is on the ground here.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:15:17] <pavel-jeffco> I see nothing at all in aeros... No Alt, Temps...
[GMT 01/13/06 21:15:53] <pavel-jeffco> Oh, I got it: the database is not loaded! Ok, I see.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:17:03] <pavel-jeffco> Oh well, they will be on the ground soon.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:17:37] <pavel-jeffco> laptop4-g5: could you give us an ETA?
[GMT 01/13/06 21:18:33] <laptop4-g5> no
[GMT 01/13/06 21:18:52] <laptop4-g5> we still have the high altitudde stuff to do yet
[GMT 01/13/06 21:19:11] <pavel-jeffco> Ok, this is accurate enough.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:29:51] <JanetScannell-fl> Ok, the data is finally getting in the database.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:35:50] <laptop4-g5> anybody down there working on our cold drinks?
[GMT 01/13/06 21:36:25] <pavel-jeffco> You didn't give us an ETA, how're we supposed to do that?
[GMT 01/13/06 21:39:49] <JanetScannell-fl> Google earth/map should be working now.  Now that they are going to be landing soon!
[GMT 01/13/06 21:40:01] <pavel-jeffco> Janet - techs tell me that HDDs on the C-130 are getting full. Can you purge them next week or tell me what we can kill off?
[GMT 01/13/06 21:40:31] <JanetScannell-fl> ok - I'll look at them next week.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:40:51] <pavel-jeffco> I see them in G-Earth now. Thanks Janet!
[GMT 01/13/06 21:43:39] <laptop4-g5> still not to altitude yet.  ATC holds
[GMT 01/13/06 21:44:38] <JanetScannell-fl> Mike's email said that he wanted to show display at 2:45.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:47:37] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> thanks for the help, i have the display and will show it!!!!

[GMT 01/13/06 21:51:21] <pavel-jeffco> The flight is going well. Completed maneuvers over Ft. Morgan, doing high-alt. testing now. They are live on GoogleEarth, too.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:52:02] <MikeDaniels-NCAR> thanks, pavel, how about somebody on the plane!?!?
[GMT 01/13/06 21:53:07] <pavel-jeffco> That would be Al Schanot on laptop4-g5. He is likely a bit busy coordinating tests with the pilots.
[GMT 01/13/06 21:53:29] <pavel-jeffco> His last request was a warm welcome on the ground... :-)
