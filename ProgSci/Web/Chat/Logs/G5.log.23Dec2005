[GMT 12/23/05 00:00:26] <Teresa-gv> Cliff, Thx much.  See you tomorrow.  BTW, we ran out of ref gas again, we'll have to consider how to add flow restriction to conserve ref gas.  But that's for next year!
[GMT 12/23/05 00:00:58] <jeffs> Im still tying to decipher the reports, but it appears that there has been severe turbulence at mid and lower levels, and strong wave turbulence at Flight level 41 to 43 kfeet
[GMT 12/23/05 00:01:39] <AlCooper-G5> Jeff, thanks for those reports.
[GMT 12/23/05 00:02:43] <CliffHeizer-Jeffco> Teresa, I left a message for Framcis at the number you provided.  Good news on CO2, bad news on REF gas.  
[GMT 12/23/05 00:02:47] <MelShapiro-G5>  jEFF--vERY  INPORTANT INFO KEEP IT--KEEP ADVISING
[GMT 12/23/05 00:05:46] <jeffs> There were two reports of severe mountain wave activity at 43 kfeet, most reports in midleves have been for moderate

[GMT 12/23/05 00:07:03] <MelShapiro-G5> lAURA--WE ARE SKIMMING THE TROPOPAUSE
[GMT 12/23/05 00:08:32] <jeffs> over Den at 35 kfeet there was a report of light turbulence by a ciation

[GMT 12/23/05 00:09:12] <AlCooper-G5> light is good, we'll be happy with light
[GMT 12/23/05 00:10:09] <jeffs> I'll bet you will find at least moderate in spots
[GMT 12/23/05 00:11:39] <jeffs> I'd avoid Flight level 430 based on the reports so far
[GMT 12/23/05 00:15:49] <AlCooper-G5> understand and thanks. We're still at 410 and don't plan to climb FYI, we just passed Brice Canyon Utah. Still a little turbulence, nothing much yet
[GMT 12/23/05 00:19:34] <AlCooper-G5> We've made the tropopause passes that Laura wanted, I think, so I've told the pilots there's no further need to hold FL410.

[GMT 12/23/05 00:27:44] <LauraPan-GV> AlCooper-G5, Thanks for the news of tropopause crossing - what is the pressure level of tropopause on your skewT?
[GMT 12/23/05 00:28:31] <LauraPan-GV> This is Laura at home not on GV
[GMT 12/23/05 00:29:11] <DonLenschow-G5> 280 -290 mb
[GMT 12/23/05 00:29:54] <LauraPan-GV>  Are you staying above it for now?
[GMT 12/23/05 00:30:23] <MelShapiro-G5> My Skew says 210 mb--we are below
[GMT 12/23/05 00:30:51] <DonLenschow-G5> below at 270 mb
[GMT 12/23/05 00:31:31] <AlCooper-G5> Laura, about 200 mb. We're below the tropopause and will remain there for the rest of the flight.
[GMT 12/23/05 00:33:09] <DonLenschow-G5> sorry, I gave you wrong heights.  should have been 210 - 220 mb
[GMT 12/23/05 00:35:56] <LauraPan-GV> Could you ask Teresa the CO reading in and out of stratosphere?
[GMT 12/23/05 00:38:15] <MelShapiro-G5> L.P.///Is there wind at you house yet??
[GMT 12/23/05 00:38:37] <Jcowan-Jeffco> We show you in colorado now.  Any update on an ETA?
[GMT 12/23/05 00:39:10] <LauraPan-GV> none. My son just biked back. He confirms that.
[GMT 12/23/05 00:39:41] <Teresa-gv> Laura, prelim CO values in strat and trop were low 70's and 100-110.
[GMT 12/23/05 00:41:06] <jeffs> no major change in turbulence pireps so far, still likely to have moderate into BJC in spots, I think
[GMT 12/23/05 00:41:26] <LauraPan-GV> Teresa, Thanks. I like these values.
[GMT 12/23/05 00:43:34] <AlCooper-G5> Jcowar-:Jeffco ETA a little uncertain because it will depend on how they have to do this approach. 6:15 would be my guess. (Don't want to bother pilots now)
[GMT 12/23/05 00:44:07] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, that sounds good.  I just wantewd to update the mechs.  See you all on the ground.
[GMT 12/23/05 00:48:23] <AlCooper-G5> Jeff, I saw that update; thanks. 
[GMT 12/23/05 00:50:20] <AlCooper-G5> 24 Kft and descending; no turbulence yet
[GMT 12/23/05 00:50:31] <jeffs> I just did a walk outside, things seem pretty calm here now.  (but I'd keep my seat belt on anyway)
[GMT 12/23/05 00:50:52] <AlCooper-G5> (well maybe just a little)
[GMT 12/23/05 00:51:41] <wasinger> looks like some wave action in your vertical wind speed
[GMT 12/23/05 00:52:01] <wasinger> +- 3 m/s
