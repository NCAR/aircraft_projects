[GMT 12/20/05 17:52:17] <AlCooper-Jeffco> DaveR-G5 It doesn't look too good for radar comparisons. The echoes in Texas are mostly moving east of your planned flight track (I think). Might be some targets for a comparison near the coast. Others at 33.5 N and 99W might be within your range? (Can't tell yet from here)
[GMT 12/20/05 17:59:03] <AlCooper-Jeffco> OK, I see your turn now and that takes you toward echoes with tops to 220 and  reflectivity > 40 dBz
[GMT 12/20/05 18:00:01] <DaveR-G5> Al- ok, thx for update. Over Tx panhandle see broken low level wimp-cumulus field. Further south, these are overlaid by thin sold stratus. Very smooth flt here so far.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:03:05] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - the best radar targets nearby are from the Dallas-Fort Worth radar. > 40 dBz there. You're heading toward it, but I don't know if you'll need to turn and pass too far to the SW of that.

[GMT 12/20/05 18:05:04] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - the radar image is almost an hour old now, so I'm hoping for an update soon. I did try to send you another update of the composite map with tops.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:08:00] <DaveR-G5> Al- I'm not sure how to access the radar images from here. Advice? 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:09:48] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - You should be able to start the Firefox browser and it will default to the latest image. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:13:46] <AlCooper-Jeffco> There is some good echo (>45 dBz) near Fort Worth. they should be about 100 mi ahead now, if they haven't changed too much in the 1/2 hr since the latest radar image.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:15:10] <DaveR-G5> Al- got it. Nifty. At 25kt, echoes will be ~LA border in 4 hours. We could consider slight east adjustment of our route to intercept.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:18:23] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - I'll send you the FWS image (latest 1806). Looks good for your present track to me also.

[GMT 12/20/05 18:23:32] <DaveR-G5> pressure rake data look okay. Shows deeper BL than earlier flights when rake was further forward, as expected. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:24:40] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - if the reported tops are right, you'll be above it at FL330. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:24:53] <DaveR-G5> (copied from &progsci channel)  pressure rake data look okay. Shows deeper BL than earlier flights when rake was further forward, as expected.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:25:56] <AlCooper-Jeffco>  -- hard to understand 50 dBz and tops only 220... I'll check IR...
[GMT 12/20/05 18:27:17] <DaveR-G5> 18:30z starting 5 minutes of autopilot & autothrottle OFF; pilots hand-flying.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:27:46] <AlCooper-Jeffco> IR tops in the -40s, still below your altitude
[GMT 12/20/05 18:29:35] <DaveR-G5> Al- KFWS radar image received. We are presently ~50SE of Dallas. See extensive cirrus below us, horizon to horizon. I could send a photo, but it's not very interesting-blue above and white below.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:30:06] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Still more serious echo ahead; can you get some photos of the radar display, or have you seen anything?
[GMT 12/20/05 18:34:38] stith (stith@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &progsci.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:34:41] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - sorry, I was late with that and you're well past the echoes as they appear on the latest update (18:35). You should have seen serious-looking echo, though, highest-level on the airborne radar, as you flow over Ft Worth? It would have been about 25 mi east of Ft Worth, I think.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:39:06] <AlCooper-Jeffco> At Houston, there's nothing but a few 25-dBz cells north of the city. There are also a few similar cells over the gulf that could be interesting to look at if you go that far offshore. I'll send that to you next.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:40:57] <stith> Dave, have  you been looking at wind speed over the last hour.  It appears to have dropped twice by quite a bit. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:43:33] <DaveR-G5> Al- we were painting discrete echoes ~30 nm across, level 3 (40dbz?). Have photos of display at tilt -1 to -2.5deg.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:44:22] <DaveR-G5> The radar display also shows nav waypoints, so we should be able to get their locations accurately.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:45:28] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - great, I have the nexrad images saved. Tops over Ft Worth now are up a lot.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:49:00] <AlCooper-Jeffco>  updated the Houston image to the 1846 display. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:49:41] <DaveR-G5> Jeff- right. Speeds decreasing as we cross the trough axis, then increasing again as we get into subtropical jet. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:49:58] <DaveR-G5> That pattern follows forecast guidance from ADDS.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:52:17] <DaveR-G5> Al- nexrad image received for KHGX. Not much going on, as you said. 
[GMT 12/20/05 18:53:14] <DaveR-G5> We are crossing ~coast now and will proceed about 5+ minutes over water before starting dropsonde tests. Just cleared to descend to FL310.
[GMT 12/20/05 18:56:08] <AlCooper-Jeffco> As a lower-echo-level test, it might be interesting to see if you see those cells ahead of you now on the radar. They're 25-30 dBZ in the latest HGX image.

[GMT 12/20/05 19:14:12] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - I think it's 150 mi radius-- I'll try to check.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:21:32] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Yes, 150 mi radius
[GMT 12/20/05 19:22:12] <AlCooper-Jeffco> (You're well past the region of those echoes now)
[GMT 12/20/05 19:26:28] <AlCooper-Jeffco> I have sent another composite, for your return planning. There are still strong echoes in the Ft Worth area and also on the Schreveport nexrad.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:28:00] <DaveR-G5> Al- we are done with dropsonde tests; four tries, four good releases & all are making data.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:28:20] <DaveR-G5> 1732z- request climb FL430 on northbound return leg. 
[GMT 12/20/05 19:31:25] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Great news on the dropsondes. FYI, strongest jet (>120 kt) is still at about FL400. 
[GMT 12/20/05 19:38:10] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Those cells are still there SE of Houston. I estimate 150/130 nm from Houston. Reflectivity to 35-40 dBz
[GMT 12/20/05 19:45:56] <DaveR-G5> Al- we are looking. Can see coastline clearly, plus a few level-1 small echoes that may be clouds. Continue to monitor and will get photos if interesting.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:47:46] <DaveR-G5> Water CN continues to make data. Its sample flow control  is steady, although ~3% high as we climbed above ~40kft.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:48:02] <DaveR-G5> Al- KHGX radar 1941z received.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:55:09] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - have sent Dallas-Fort Worth nexrad image for 1950. Still strong cells there. I don't see much at San Antonio or other nearby Texas sites.
[GMT 12/20/05 19:56:28] <stith> Dave, there are still some echoes east of DFW that are small but might be worth flying around or through the weaker parts if you and the pilots want to check out the onboard radar as a part of CHAPS

[GMT 12/20/05 20:13:12] <DaveR-G5> Al & Jeff - image received. We are seeing some echoes 150 miles out, level red; our eleven o'clock position.
[GMT 12/20/05 20:13:42] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Dave - sent 2013 FWS radar. Still strong cells there, with small area of reflectivity to 50 dBz
[GMT 12/20/05 20:25:11] <DaveR-G5> Al- image rec'd. 
[GMT 12/20/05 20:25:33] <AlCooper-Jeffco> and here comes 2024, because it changed significantly from previous
[GMT 12/20/05 20:29:08] <AlCooper-Jeffco> I see you're past the echoes (going past, or through, a small one?), so I'm going to the planning meeting for a few minutes.

[GMT 12/20/05 20:55:56] <DaveR-G5> Al- okay. We show targets yellow/red at 150 miles and think they are cities, not clouds.
[GMT 12/20/05 20:58:10] <AlCooper-Jeffco> maybe Wichita?
[GMT 12/20/05 20:59:49] <AlCooper-Jeffco> (Wichita nexrad is echo-free)
[GMT 12/20/05 21:01:07] <DaveR-G5> Pressure rake continues to make data.  All 12 pitots are showing negative pressures. qcrake is about 96 mb, and pitot closest to it is about 3mb smaller.
[GMT 12/20/05 21:02:37] <DaveR-G5> Indicates BL depth is ~11 inches at location gvsf 498-R top, overhead the chem operator's seat.
[GMT 12/20/05 21:48:00] <Teresa-GV> Dave, that's an interesting result for 498-R.

[GMT 12/20/05 21:49:04] <Teresa-GV> Dave, it would seem to be inconsistent with the Gulfstream data, if i remember correctly.  But then,wasn't their data for centerline?
[GMT 12/20/05 22:00:27] <BillIrwin-GV> We're about 12 minutes out or so
[GMT 12/20/05 22:06:39] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- Yes. GAC plot is for top and bottom of fuselage along centerline for "clean" aircraft. I'm not sure if it is based on modeling or measurements. Have to check.
[GMT 12/20/05 22:07:30] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- if 498R is inside BL at 11 inches, then HIMIL is too short for that location.
