[GMT 12/12/05 09:18:26] <ads-G5> I was watching to see them start on the status page...
[GMT 12/12/05 09:18:43] <ads-G5> where is the core file?

[GMT 12/12/05 09:19:43] <ads-G5> what is the the solution?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:19:46] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Did you turn on any other serial instruments 6 minutes ago?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:20:00] <ads-G5> just those two...

[GMT 12/12/05 09:20:24] <ads-G5> shoud I turn them off?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:20:28] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> no.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:20:46] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> thye should all be on before we start the dsm anyways.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:21:01] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> did you restart dsm_server & nimbus?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:21:32] <ads-G5> not yet... I'll restart the DSMs as well...
[GMT 12/12/05 09:24:56] <ads-G5> all restarted... and back up

[GMT 12/12/05 09:27:13] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> It's just sending a '\n' when core dumps.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:27:17] <ads-G5> I can't locate the psi9116 in the status page for the chaps rack...

[GMT 12/12/05 09:28:29] <ads-G5> is PRAKE still in the xml config?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:29:45] <ads-G5> aerosol racks CN counter is off as well
[GMT 12/12/05 09:30:41] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> if that gets turned on, you will need to manually rserial in and sm,4,1 to it.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:30:59] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ask the tech if that instr is to be used.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:32:03] <ads-G5>  Dave R. doesn't want to run the CN counter this flight... (we will be flying at the wrong altitude for it's use)
[GMT 12/12/05 09:32:55] <ads-G5> tdlh20 will be powered on after power transfer...
[GMT 12/12/05 09:33:44] <ads-G5> has that sensor given us any trouble?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:35:10] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I traced the problem to dsmser2, which is either DewPointer or ADIFR.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:35:22] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ADIFR is powered on with system, so I suspect DewPointer.
[GMT 12/12/05 09:35:32] <ads-G5> psi9116 is stall in the xml...
[GMT 12/12/05 09:36:10] <ads-G5> i'll check its prake12_dump after we take off and power it up
[GMT 12/12/05 09:37:30] <ads-G5> John C, updated the startup procedures to start the dew pointers prior to dsm startup
[GMT 12/12/05 09:38:07] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> and you siad they were turned after dsm_Server crashed?
[GMT 12/12/05 09:38:46] <ads-G5> I checked that psi9116 is still in the xml...

[GMT 12/12/05 10:07:35] <ChrisWebster-Bed> yes
[GMT 12/12/05 10:07:46] <ChrisWebster-Bed> what happened?
[GMT 12/12/05 10:08:35] <ChrisWebster-Bed> You just passed right over eisenhower tunnel.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:08:42] <ads-G5> DPL is not showing dew point now.  It seems to be just floating.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:09:00] <ads-G5> The dew point light is not lit.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:09:19] <AVAPS-GV> what if we cycle them seperately...
[GMT 12/12/05 10:09:19] <ChrisWebster-Bed> cycle it I guess . be prepared for dsm_server & nimbus to crash.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:09:29] <ads-G5> I talked with Dave R and he said we can just ignore it for now.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:09:33] <AVAPS-GV> 10-4
[GMT 12/12/05 10:09:59] <ads-G5> He does not want to risk a data system crash at this time.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:10:11] <AVAPS-GV> I'll watch rserial when we cycle them too see what happens
[GMT 12/12/05 10:11:50] <ChrisWebster-Bed> only cycle what's not working.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:13:14] <ads-G5> It's not working but the PI says not to mess with it since DPR is used in the depend table and everything looks okay.  I'll try to max cool it and see if that corrects the problem.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:13:54] <AVAPS-GV> we could stopping  dsm304's dsm_engine  prior to restarting the dewpointers
[GMT 12/12/05 10:14:10] <ChrisWebster-Bed> JohnW was implying cycling both.  If one is working, don't cycle both, doubles the chance of a crash...
[GMT 12/12/05 10:14:33] <ChrisWebster-Bed> never mind, late night reading.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:14:43] <ads-G5> Okay I would only cycle the bdad one.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:16:22] shanhu-g5 (ads@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 12/12/05 10:16:23] <ChrisWebster-Bed> AVAPS-GV if that would prevent a dsm_server crash, that would be preferable.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:16:50] <AVAPS-GV> it would... 
[GMT 12/12/05 10:17:54] <ads-G5> ChrisWebster-Bed, I think we would lose the IRS stuff and that would be a real problem.  Everything is messed up then.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:19:55] <ChrisWebster-Bed> ads-G5 You'll loose everything if dsm_server crashes....
[GMT 12/12/05 10:20:36] <ChrisWebster-Bed> ads-G5 including your database history for track/data, etc.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:21:50] <ChrisWebster-Bed> ads-G5 the call is up to guys up there, just be watching the dsm_server & nimbus window when you do it.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:21:51] <ads-G5> I think that we will just leave it for now.  The PI's would prefer that. I assume that this is a temporary  problem with cycleing the dewpointers and causing the data system to crash.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:22:41] <ChrisWebster-Bed> ads-G5 yes, I put in a bug report to Gordon, it should only take him about 15 minutes to fix this.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:23:26] <ads-G5> We got a laptop crash right now.  I'll let you know what we decide to do on the dew point later.

[GMT 12/12/05 10:25:51] <pavel-jeffco> I'd rather you dont risk a data system crash since one is working.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:26:16] <pavel-jeffco> yes, what?
[GMT 12/12/05 10:26:59] <cliff-gv> Pavel, I thought you were smart enough to go home!
[GMT 12/12/05 10:27:09] <ads-G5> pavel-jeffco, That is the general feeling here.  I might do it on the return whan things are quite but we have a schedual to keep this morning.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:28:21] <pavel-jeffco> I agree. Once you risk no important dat aloss, you could try cycling it just to see if it helps, but otherwise, leave it. We're on the same page here.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:29:08] <ChrisWebster-Bed> how's the laptop?  what crashed?
[GMT 12/12/05 10:29:13] <pavel-jeffco> I am out for a few hours. 'Be back later.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:29:28] <ads-G5> Okay Pavel that is what we will do then.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:30:37] <ads-G5> ChrisWebster-Bed, it was the forward right. John is looking at it.  Looks like it is rebooting now.
[GMT 12/12/05 10:32:13] <DaveR-GV> TDL mixing ratios seem okay. Dewpointers would be struggling to make good data at this altitude anyhow, so they are not primary for humidity.

[GMT 12/12/05 15:17:04] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Good morning HIAPER, How are things - how was the wave flight? I assume that the winds low down were too weak and that you hardly saw temperature excursions during the high-level leg over San bernadino?
[GMT 12/12/05 15:17:55] <schanot_jeffco> Hello Dave.  Can you tell me if the CN counter is working again?  Would we want to put aCN counter on the C-130 for the intercomparison?
[GMT 12/12/05 15:18:09] <JohnWasinger-GV> JanetScannell-Jeffco, is the weather images being served to the aircraft?

[GMT 12/12/05 15:20:01] <schanot_jeffco> John Cowan. The temps are very noisy intermitantly.  It would be helpful to have someone record the times of the pilot's radion communications for a while to compare for RFI.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:20:03] <laptop2-GV> Good morning Jorgen,  things are going perfect-- however, we didn't see the wave.

[GMT 12/12/05 15:20:55] <laptop2-GV> When return we will look at more that area
[GMT 12/12/05 15:20:56] <ads-G5> Al we are doing HF right now at about 20 minute intervals.  I cannot monitor the HF coms.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:21:41] <schanot_jeffco> I know you can't John, but maybe the pilots could for a short "test" period.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:22:11] <DaveR-GV> Jorgen-- We did not see waves over southern CA, although we did encounter some after, ~12:40z.  Wx pattern is complicated by the upper level wave with tilted axis.

[GMT 12/12/05 15:24:35] <JohnWasinger-GV> JanetScannell-Jeffco, ok... no one was requesting these images for this flight up here.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:24:37] <DaveR-GV> Jorgen- The water CN does not make data when above ~18kft. We are still waiting delivery of our #1, calibrated CN counter. I don't see CN as a primary comparison between C130 and GV, at least not until we have a chance to compare butanol vs water instruments in the lab first.

[GMT 12/12/05 15:26:14] <JohnWasinger-GV> JanetScannell-Jeffco, are the requests ftp requests originate from the GV?
[GMT 12/12/05 15:26:28] <JohnWasinger-GV> JanetScannell-Jeffco, do ftp requests originate from the GV?
[GMT 12/12/05 15:27:58] <JanetScannell-Jeffco> JohnWasinger-GV: The images originate from the ground.  
[GMT 12/12/05 15:28:03] <DaveR-GV> Altitude excursions on the southbound leg were made to stay above cirrus clouds. When we got to southern end, the sun was rising, and we could see that these clouds were a mix of in-situ cirrus and blow-off from convection.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:30:19] LowellGenzlinger-ops (LowellGenz@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:31:23] <JohnWasinger-GV> JanetScannell-Jeffco, are requests for new images made by the PI here on board... that is if he or she wants the image service it is activated for a given flight.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:33:45] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Dave, many thanks for the update.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:33:49] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> JohnW there are 3 different PI groups on this project.  I believe only 1 of them is using the image upload stuff (Laura Pan & Lenschow).
[GMT 12/12/05 15:34:41] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> John,no images were needed/requested for this flight, at least not that I am aware of. hence there may be a good reason for now new updates, unless you guys do it for a test.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:35:04] <JohnWasinger-GV> ok.. that makes sense...
[GMT 12/12/05 15:38:41] <JohnWasinger-GV> was it working for the last flight?  I recall that the web page was not working last time.  To get around this they viewed the files in the http://hyper/upimages individually.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:45:20] stith (stith@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:46:08] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> JohnW it has worked on the last flight images were requested.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:46:56] <JohnWasinger-GV> CJW, ok...
[GMT 12/12/05 15:49:20] <DaveR-GV> re satellite images - none were needed for this flight, although they could have provided some guidance about the cirrus. We probably should have thought of that before flight.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:49:43] <stith> Hi guys how is the flight going?  Want to say anything to the 9:00 meeting?  I noticed that there was a slight shift in the vertical wind baseline about 13:45
[GMT 12/12/05 15:50:00] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Dave, just browse the web from up there...

[GMT 12/12/05 15:51:20] <laptop2-GV> Jeff, the flight is going very well.  During the night (all the way to Manzanillo), nanoDMA didn't show any small particles, but on the way back with sunlight, there are lots of tiny guys there...

[GMT 12/12/05 15:51:50] <laptop2-GV> Jeff, although, we missed the wave that Jorgen expected.

[GMT 12/12/05 15:52:09] <laptop2-GV> We will look at them when we return.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:53:08] <stith> The weather should be great for your landing.  Warm and sunny, with snow on the mountains.   We should have some guests to see you land, I think
[GMT 12/12/05 15:53:44] <schanot_jeffco> John Cowan.  We want to do a brief RFI check when you guys get back on the ground.  Once you taxi to the ramp, keep ads running and have the pilots transmit on both HF and com.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:54:17] <schanot_jeffco> Got to go to the 0900 MOnday meeting.
[GMT 12/12/05 15:54:21] <laptop2-GV> Thanks, Jeff
[GMT 12/12/05 15:54:28] <ads-G5> Okay I will let the poilots know.  Do they need to talk to someone HF or just transmit?
[GMT 12/12/05 15:55:05] <ads-G5> I will try and record times of radio xmit on the return leg.

[GMT 12/12/05 16:06:32] <DaveR-GV> Pressure rake seems to be working ok.
[GMT 12/12/05 16:20:34] <laptop2-GV> Jorgen, because of the air traffic, we are stuck in the statosphere here from 28N,,,
[GMT 12/12/05 16:29:51] <laptop2-GV> Jorgen,  when do we have meeting today for tomorrow's flight.  I want to be there,,, Please make sure this with me  -shanhu
[GMT 12/12/05 16:34:40] <ads-G5> Feet dry.
[GMT 12/12/05 16:44:39] <ads-G5> Current ETA 1115L.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:04:17] <schanot_jeffco> John Cowan- we only want a transmission check on the HFtest, they don't really need to talk to someone.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:04:43] <schanot_jeffco> Planning meeting for next PS flt will be in the library at 1 PM today.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:05:45] <ads-G5> Okay Al I will pass that on.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:07:13] <ads-G5> Al Look at temps VS nosetemp.  You might find it interesting.  If you want to talk further join me on &Techs.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:17:40] ChrisWebster-MangyMoose (cjw@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:21:04] <ads-G5> ETA still 1115L so I would think we should be close at this point.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:23:18] Nick change: DaveR-GV -> shanhu_g5
[GMT 12/12/05 17:23:45] Nick change: laptop2-GV -> DaveR-g5
[GMT 12/12/05 17:36:33] <pavel-jeffco> You are south of Grand Junction.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:37:59] <ads-G5> Yep. thats what the AVAPS says.  Just starting our decent.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:38:24] <shanhu_g5> Jorgen, we didn't see the mountain wave when we return either...  no temp fluctuations at all...  No wave today.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:44:44] <shanhu_g5> Jorgen, today we didn't tracked down the same routes - because of the air traffic.  We ended up staying in the stratosphere over an hour, at low latitudes...
[GMT 12/12/05 17:45:21] <shanhu_g5> would it be bad idea if i wanted to do this exp once more??
[GMT 12/12/05 17:46:12] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> ads-GV you are passing over Crested Butte.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:46:20] <shanhu_g5> instead of canadian flight?
[GMT 12/12/05 17:46:55] <ads-G5> Pretty close.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:48:19] <ads-G5> Going to cross right over Fairplay.
[GMT 12/12/05 17:58:58] <ads-G5> On Approach over Denver.
[GMT 12/12/05 18:00:53] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> John Cowan.  Important instructions.
[GMT 12/12/05 18:01:59] <ads-G5> Better hurry.
[GMT 12/12/05 18:02:16] <ads-G5> We are on final.
[GMT 12/12/05 18:03:05] <ChrisWebster-MangyMoose> Do RFI test on ground as planned.  Then with everything else stable, power cycle the DSM's and record data again for 5 more minutes.
[GMT 12/12/05 18:03:32] <ads-G5> Okay, Pilots are going to LOVE that.
