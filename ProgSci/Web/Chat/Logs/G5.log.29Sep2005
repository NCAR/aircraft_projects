[GMT 09/29/05 19:20:14] <ads-G5> I like the new display system.  I think you can get a lot more information quicker from it.
[GMT 09/29/05 19:20:52] <BillIrwin-G5> it's easier to use, simply because of all the displays you can keep up and quickly glance at to keep an eye on things
[GMT 09/29/05 19:21:07] <ads-G5> It was a little one and from up here you could tell where they watered and where they did not.
