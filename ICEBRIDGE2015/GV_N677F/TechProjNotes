11 Oct
Switch over day, went over everything, sat comm, the hoses put in for the windows (nice job there John M) and feel like we (Bill and Ed) were well informed by Dave and John M.  Supported Tom B rest of day.

12 Oct RF-10 flight tech Bill I.  
Take off scheduled for 10 am local.
All systems came up as expected.  Sat Comm failed once on ground during fueling.
1330 first attempt Iridium call, see Iridium on handset, pilots getting busy signal
Pilots reset breaker, phone was always busy.
Call made, Iridium restarted successfully
QCR and QCR Temp died at approx. 1430...looks like a slow fade away...perhaps cold?
Otherwise flight was uneventful.  Possible overflight of airport for calibrations..if clear enough.
Called every 1/2 hour...had to reset C/B 3 times.
landing just before 8 pm local.

was able to clear qcr fine, blew soft air thru and sucked ...got 99 percent of it out.  Checked on windows, supported NASA folks.

16Oct15 Hard Down Day

17Oct15 RF-12  Tech Bill, take off 0900local/1200UDT.  Tom did system back up, on external drive in rear facing drawer on ads rack.  Heavy winds down runway.  Long 11.8 hour flight, diverted to Purta Montt due to high winds everywhere else.  Had to over night at Puerta Montt and hold over another day...so 2 nights there.  Fly back the 19th. 15 hour day.  Multiple issues with getting ATC on phone, we can phone out, but can't get ahold of Chile ATC, keeps sending us to Schofield Barracks Army base Hawaii, same number, can dial anyone else it seems.  HF worked some and had Vidal call in for us other times.

18Oct15, spend most of day on stand by trying to get back to Punta Arenas...not successful due to high winds.  Re checked in at hotel..no change of clothes.

19Oct15. RF-13, Crew bus picks us up from Radisson Hotel at 0800, big trouble getting APU door open, pain.  Take off just a few minutes past 10:00 am local...noticed temps don't agree, restarted DSM's in nose/MPDB to fix.  2 minutes later all good on DSM's.  landing between 11:30 and noon local depends if we do fly bys for calibrations or not, weather dependant.

21 Oct 2015

Maint. Day, opened radome up and cleaned out water ...not much but opened at Enviro. Box and blew air jet thru nose holes, moved less than 1/2 a drop of water from top line.  
Support Tom B. and software, hopefully fixed NIMBUS issues had last flight, got flights numbered back to reality.  Tested phone system alot...seems since big wind storm some numbers in Chile work and some do not.  Unfortunately the phones to ATC/Control Tower do not seem to work from airplane.  Otherwise phone system works fine calling other places...even some in Chile.

22 Oct 2015

RF-15 Take off scheduled for 0900L tech Bill I.  Hope all works.  
Flight was normal for Icebridge type of flight.  HF works to about 75 south, then need
position phoned in by PM.  King George Island has a radar on it, and served as our ATC for a period of time...who knew.  Doing over flights of Punta Arenas airport before landing...hope to be on ground a 17:50L.  Nice 10.9 or so.
Nimbus worked all flight long.  Did not try phone calls.  Until we test on ground and get a connection we probably won't.
That's all I got.

23 Oct 2015 Hard Down Day

24 Oct 2015

27 Oct 2015
RF-17 Tech Bill 
Delayed take off...then cancelled flight...then because we are out of time and already fueled, decided to go fly after all.  A touch confusing but...we're going flying.  Take off just after 10am local 1300Z.  So far all looks good.  Brent on flight too.  4 hours into flight, boring, cloud cover is fairly extensive and fairly deep.  Some holes, but we are seeking different locations for data. Going to be every bit of a 11 hour flight, with delayed take off and post flight suspect we will bust crew duty day 3rd time this half of project.

28 Oct 2015

Mx day - helped NASA folks clean LVIS window, brief inventory of boxes here in the newly arrived
seatainer and emailed John C. the details.

Ran Auto A/D calibration with the following results:
DSM 303 Card 0 Ch 3 PDUMPPL has off set of 11 mv.  This has been constant for a while now.
All other channels were within 5 MV of last calibration

Off load is complete.  Starting setup for ORCAS.
