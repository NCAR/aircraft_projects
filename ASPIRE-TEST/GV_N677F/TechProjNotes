ASPIRE Test RF01

Flt Tech: Ed 

Pre-flight: 

Discussed flt-ops for optical bench & LN2 (pilots, mechs, techs) 
with users - more discussion needed

Jenna declined N2 window purge


Takeoff 1638

Fwd camera inop - no cameras found, driver issue suspected

VXL2 is not working

1655 QCR iced-up?

Turned on N2 purge after tiny ice particles noticed between window panes at 47Kft
(on both top and side windows). It did help to clear the ice somewhat, need to 
purge sooner on flt days.  The Mott frit on the N2 delivers 500 sccm at 30 psi,
this is then teed to both windows with 1/8" od teflon tubing, or 250 sccm to each window.
N2 cylinder has ~900 psi remaining. 

TCAB may be reading higher than actual cabin temp - maybe by +5 deg C,
just a guess by me

1934 QCR came back on descent thru 20Kft

Land 1955

Had to select "Connect real-time onboard" in Aeros for L6 display laptop.

DPR and DPL lost dewpoints after coming down from 47000 feet. It's expected.
