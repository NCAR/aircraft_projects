ORCAS project


11/6/15
Ran auto A/D caibration with new header.  DSM 310 was not onboard.  All other analog channels were okay.  We had seen issues on past projects with ch 4 in DSM 303 card A0, it will run 12 MV off the old calibration.  We are watching it for now.

Replaced the fan switch in DSM 305 (Nose).  The fan should now come on at 21C (70F) and turn off about 2C (35F).

Began cf01 pressure cals (Ta/ek)

11/09/2015 
Blew out water from T to drain that was not noticed on Friday (Ta/ek) saved
as cf02 because data acq would not let us continue cf01

11/10/15 
Began cf03 because could not continue cf02 (Ta/ek), somehow nimbus kept crashing.
T-Ball says it's because of the header change to ORCAS (?).  Began cf04 P-cals.

Ran auto cal on a/d cards.  Had error message for A/D s/n 11 ch 3 -10 V input was -8.8V.  Looking at the calibration this is okay.  ADS rack S/N 1705 ch 3 has 7 mv offset.  This is a known issues and we will not do anything at this time.

DSM 310 card 1701 all calibrations were off significantly.  Ch1 160 mv, ch 2 50 mv, ch3 140 mv, ch 4 7 mv.  Auto cal ran twice. DSM rebooted and this card did not start correctly. rebooted again. Card failed to boot again.  Chris got it tp boot.  Looked like DSM process did not start.  We rebooted 3 times and it came up.  We found that 1701 had been removed during vet check so that is not the card in the stack.  Database calls out 1605 we will try that. Autocalibration looks good now.  Card is 1605.

Installed Project_Tech_Docs folder on desktop and put the project information in it.

Powered up all the infrustructure and saw it work.  Did not run anything through 2dc or cdp.  Saw UHSAS histograms on laptop but did not check the data system.  Everything is talking and should be good for flight next week.
