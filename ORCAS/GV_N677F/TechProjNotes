ORCAS project


11/6/15
Ran auto A/D caibration with new header.  DSM 310 was not onboard.  All other analog channels were okay.  We had seen issues on past projects with ch 4 in DSM 303 card A0, it will run 12 MV off the old calibration.  We are watching it for now.

Replaced the fan switch in DSM 305 (Nose).  The fan should now come on at 21C (70F) and turn off about 2C (35F).

JC

Began cf01 pressure cals (Ta/ek)

11/09/2015 
Blew out water from T to drain that was not noticed on Friday (Ta/ek) saved
as cf02 because data acq would not let us continue cf01

11/10/15 
Began cf03 because could not continue cf02 (Ta/ek), somehow nimbus kept crashing.
T-Ball says it's because of the header change to ORCAS (?).  Began cf04 P-cals.

4Dec15

Did CDP cals.  Hangar config named 4Dec14.  NetCDF processed on plane and delivered to Jorgen along with screen pics.


 12/30/15
Ran auto cal on a/d cards.  Had error message for A/D s/n 11 ch 3 -10 V input was -8.8V.  Looking at the calibration this is okay.  ADS rack S/N 1705 ch 3 has 7 mv offset.  This is a known issues and we will not do anything at this time.

DSM 310 card 1701 all calibrations were off significantly.  Ch1 160 mv, ch 2 50 mv, ch3 140 mv, ch 4 7 mv.  Auto cal ran twice. DSM rebooted and this card did not start correctly. rebooted again. Card failed to boot again.  Chris got it tp boot.  Looked like DSM process did not start.  We rebooted 3 times and it came up.  We found that 1701 had been removed during vet check so that is not the card in the stack.  Database calls out 1605 we will try that. Autocalibration looks good now.  Card is 1605.

Installed Project_Tech_Docs folder on desktop and put the project information in it.

Powered up all the infrustructure and saw it work.  Did not run anything through 2dc or cdp.  Saw UHSAS histograms on laptop but did not check the data system.  Everything is talking and should be good for flight next week.

TF01 - Kyle
Takeoff: 19:12
Landing: 23:14

Overall, things looked great.

Preflight, Chris W. had to do a workaround to get satcom going but was expected. Shouldn't be a problem once we leave for Chile.

Preflight, DSM 310 driver wasn't loading for the counter card.  Chris W fixed it.

Dew Pointers are doing there thing at high altitudes.  We are gonna pull and clean on tomorrows maintenance day.

Nimbus lagging quite a bit.  Lots of yellow warning and even some red stopped showed up but recovered and worked the whole flight.  Chris W. is aware of this problem and we have seen it in the past.

GNI had issues and had to be turned off.  We need some training on this instrument.

Saw returns on all wing probes at some point during the flight except RICE.  No icing conditions.

VCSEL will be pulled to resplice a fiber tomorrow.  Worked fine during the flight.


6Jan16

Cleaned Dewpointers.

Removed VCSEL for fiber work.

VCSEL reinstalled.

Removed GNI plate for modification.

1/7/16

Pre TF02

Re installed GNI plate.

TCAB came up NAN.  Analog voltage voltage check was okay.  not sure what the issue is. Disconnected analog cable and went to 0V.  Reconnected cable and it works.  Look at it tomorrow.  Sensor os loose.


Block out 1855
Take off 1859

1907 Still noticing a difference between DP's in climb. DPR tracks VCSEL but DPL seems to just wander.

2058 TOGA could not hear but they could talk.  Turned out it was a bad PTT.  Replaced with onboard spare.

2104 DPL still messed up at FL11.

2120 GNI power cycled.  Jorgan wanted it off for the rest of the flight so it is now off.

2130 Look at QCLS head set and see if mike is weak.

2140 Power back on GNI for the rest of the flight for heaters.

2156 Seeing some blank records or stuck bits on 2DC-10 during some light chop. Continues as we climb.

2211 2DC run away stopped as we leveled off.

2342 Seeing stuck bit on decent also.

2345 Starting to see real 2DC images interspersed with streakers.
