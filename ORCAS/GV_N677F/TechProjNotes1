ORCAS project

11/6/15
Ran auto A/D calibration with new header.  DSM 310 was not onboard.  All other analog channels were okay.  We had seen issues on past projects with ch 4 in DSM 303 card A0, it will run 12 MV off the old calibration.  We are watching it for now.

Replaced the fan switch in DSM 305 (Nose).  The fan should now come on at 21C (70F) and turn off about 2C (35F).

Began cf01 pressure cals (Ta/ek)

Blew out water from T to drain that was not noticed on Friday (Ta/ek) saved
as cf02 because data acq would not let us continue cf01

11/10/15 
Began cf03 because could not continue cf02 (Ta/ek), somehow nimbus kept crashing.
T-Ball says it's because of the header change to ORCAS (?).  Began cf04 P-cals.
