Production data archived to the CISL Mass Store System (MSS) before this date
will be replaced with a "final" production data set (with merged files) after
this date.  To my knowledge no one has downloaded any of these files from the
MSS (certainly none from the EOL Data Retrieval web page).

Archived most of the reprocessed LRT data.  The two files with incorrect dates
now have incorrect years!  Note sent to Pavel to correct it.  (Corrected by
the time I've completed this.  I'll now archive the others.)

No units for following:
   AVGTRNS_LWI
   CNT1
   OVFLW_LWI
   REJAT_LWI

   ncap2 -s 'PVOL3_RWI=PVOL3_RWI*1.0e6' PACDEXrf##.nc new_PACDEXrf##.nc

that is multiply PVOL by 1 million.

and the following command will modify an existing attribute:

  ncatted -a units,PVOL3_RWI,m,c,um3/m3 PACDEXrf##.nc
