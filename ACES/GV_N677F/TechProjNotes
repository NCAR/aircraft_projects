Miantenance Day
3/21/24
When aircraft pulled out noticed that the Right Side Master Fault light was on.  WE tested each inverter alone and found that the fault light comes on even when a know good inverter was installed. We suspect an issue with the fault light but will look at it after the project.

Later in the day power was removed.  Once the ADS load was put on the right side the light went out.  Testing at end of day had the light come back on.

3/22/24 at power up the fault light was off.



Flight TF01
3/22/24

BO 1505
TO 1512

Onboard cameras show critical on controls page even though they are recording.

iPM sensor not functioning.

1718 power cycled DPR (is actually the DPL head) due to high Balance and to verify heads were swpped.

DPR_Bal is 7K at altitude.  Looks better at lower alts I think.  We will see when we get on approach for landing.

DPR head does not have blue light saying contrlling at altitude.

Variable not correct.
GGREFID - NAN
GGREDID_232 - NAN
PSFF - 0
PSFFC - NAN
QCTFC - NAN
TASTF - NAN

Add to checklist to turn on and off nitogren flow.

PSTF is nan during preflight.  Tried rebooting two times with no success.   Didn't try during the flight due to SOA looking a pitch.

No issues.

Prior to flight, the server wouldn't boot.  Mike Paxton got it going.  We are carrying along a spare server and installed a linux laptop in L6. Kim reported that during the prior maintenance flight that power swap was really hard.  Some procedure in the cockpit was not done correctly.  There was no research power but this may be related to our issue.  Like a spike down the ground path or something.   

Satcom had to be rebooted once to come up.

Had to name FF01 to FFO2 because the default_ipm header wasn't allowing DSM 303 data to be displayed in aeros. This will have to be adjusted post flight. No IPM data this flight.

Camera not displaying on browser.



DPR in rebalance.  Probably needs a cleaning.

Server booted properly. Brought everything up and all looks good.  Started cameras with success. DPR started with success.

No satcom preflight and during takeoff. It started working after takeoff sometime around 16:35. Thrane and Thrane page showed excessive writes to the flash drive.  SBU Fail led eventually cleared and the Thrane and Thrane page warning cleared as well.

Cameras didn't start. Tried multiple times with no success.


TF05
Flight Tech: Kyle
Takeoff: 15:54
Landing:

During preflight, the cameras wouldn't start.  Recycled power on the camera by pulling and inserting the Ethernet cable fixed it.

Divert to Mesa, AZ for aircraft maintenance.

No PSTF in preflight.  I opted to not reboot 305 at this point to be safe.

Camera stopped at 16:55. Cycled power, stopped camera process, restarted camera process and it came back at 17:13.  Happened again at 20:32.  Started at 21:00.

DSM 305 had a hard time coming up during preflight.  Took three power cycles to come up.  No PSTF.  Rebooted it at 17:34 during flight and all is working including PSTF.
