Preflight

Misuderstanding lead to a shift to APU power which dropped r-buss and all backend power. Upon power up it was noticed that the #1 fault light on the right side 60 Hz was on. Since it was not found right away it was decided to leave it as it is for the flight.  The right side is very lightly loaded.

There was also a 30 min delay on the ramp for clouds to clear.

BP 1420
TO 1425

Forwasr camera script and icon are working but not seeing images.  There are green blinking lights on the hub and the camera.  SE's informed/

1513 noticed that PSTF was NAN.  Looked at back dat and it dropped at 1337 when the power was lost and never recovered.  Decided that since PSF was working and we would beed to potential reboot DSM's to leave it as is for now.  Need to be checked on ground.
