Pilot Pro Notes

- VCSEL not showing a valid dew point. SAMPLE_LSRINT_VXL indicates saturation is the issue.
- MTP dropped out after touch and goes. Elected to leave down for return flight in the abscence of a startup procedure. 
- 2DS needs optics need to be cleaned. obstructions noted on both horizontal and vertical array elements.
-Forward camera feed showed static and intermtent images. catherine restarted camera feed to resolve.

Tech: Richard Freeman
Date: April 7, 2022

Takeoff:1607
Landing:1954

Pre-flight
-2DS element volts all above 1.5 V. Vertical channel still producing false counts but much less severe than before cleaning.


Flight

Camera images never displayed withing catalog maps on acserver. No view of down camera accesible onboard.

VCSEL - SMPLSRINT_VXL ran near saturation point (2700) or above for majority of the flight.

1818 - Power cycled down camera POE injector at L3 rack at Chris Websters request.



RF03
Tech: Richard Freeman
Date: April 13, 2022

Takeoff: 1735
Landing: 2258

Pre-flight:
2DS - Relative Humidity at 18% all element voltages above 1.5V
    - Applied mask to vertical channel
 

Flight:
Could not start cameras after takeoff. Desktop button consistently showed an application error splash screen. Attempted to run via terminal twice without success. terminal output loop an error message with an error code -13. (Catherine and Chris were able to fix later in flight.

1808 - 2DS generating many false particles on the verticle channel. Applied mask to stuck bit in vertical array.


1824 - DPL and DPR went out of balance. cycled power without result.
1840 - Reset USHAS-G software
1844 - Reset power to down camera at L2 rack PoE box.
1931 - Service mirror light indicator came on for DPR
2018 - Cycled power on both dew pointers. Lost all DSM variables for one minute as a result. (known grounding issue related to PSF?) 
2020 - Reset UHSASG software
2105 - Both Dew Pointers service mirror light turned on. Per Cory, decided to leave both off rather than risk a reset of other flight variables.
