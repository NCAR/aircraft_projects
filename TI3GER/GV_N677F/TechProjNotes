Pilot Pro Notes

- VCSEL not showing a valid dew point. SAMPLE_LSRINT_VXL indicates saturation is the issue.
- MTP dropped out after touch and goes. Elected to leave down for return flight in the abscence of a startup procedure. 
- 2DS needs optics need to be cleaned. obstructions noted on both horizontal and vertical array elements.
-Forward camera feed showed static and intermtent images. catherine restarted camera feed to resolve.

Date: April 7, 2022

Takeoff:1607
Landing:1954

Pre-flight
-2DS element volts all above 1.5 V. Vertical channel still producing false counts but much less severe than before cleaning.


Flight

Camera images never displayed withing catalog maps on acserver. No view of down camera accesible onboard.

VCSEL - SMPLSRINT_VXL ran near saturation point (2700) or above for majority of the flight.

1715 - Lines swapped and capped at rack R1 by Lee Mauldin for second configuration.

1818 - Power cycled down camera POE injector at L3 rack at Chris Websters request.

Tech: Richard Freeman
Date: April 13, 2022

Takeoff: 1735
Landing: 2258

Pre-flight:
2DS - Relative Humidity at 18% all element voltages above 1.5V
    - Applied mask to vertical channel
 

Flight:
Could not start cameras after takeoff. Desktop button consistently showed an application error splash screen. Attempted to run via terminal twice without success. terminal output loop an error message with an error code -13. (Catherine and Chris were able to fix later in flight.

1808 - 2DS generating many false particles on the verticle channel. Applied mask to stuck bit in vertical array.


1824 - DPL and DPR went out of balance. cycled power without result.
1840 - Reset USHAS-G software
1844 - Reset power to down camera at L2 rack PoE box.
1931 - Service mirror light indicator came on for DPR
2018 - Cycled power on both dew pointers. Lost all DSM variables for one minute as a result. (known grounding issue related to PSF?) 
2020 - Reset UHSASG software
2105 - Both Dew Pointers service mirror light turned on. Per Cory, decided to leave both off rather than risk a reset of other flight variables.

Date: 20 April 2022

Takeoff: 1759Z
Landing:


Pre-FLight:
ADC altitude variables PALT_A, PALT_A2, and PALT reporting as ~-27 meters. All tracking each other closely. Attempted reset of of AC server and AENT device #2 without result. All other values for ADC look within normal range. Novatel Altitude looks good. Follow up from Catherine indicating negative altitudes are fairly common at sea level.

2DS array voltages all above 1.9 V. Very little false particle trigger on the ground.
2DS RH at 15 percent

Flight:


1811 - ushas reset
1823 - 2ds particles detected
1837 - lost down facing camera due to software issue. Chris W resolved  at 1838
1909 - power cycled down camera POE injector for Catherine
2320 - restarted VCSEL
0005 - Near total occlusion of the 2DS horizontal channel. Applied mask effectively disabling. any particle detection.
 

- sporadic connection to down camera throughout flight. likely a connector issue under the floor. no action taken in flight.

RF06
Tech: Richard Freeman
Date: 21 April 2022

Pre-Flight:

- Noticed status page flashed critical on all entries for a brief moment.
- Cleaned 2DS and CDP windows
- 2DS horizontal array voltages all around 2 V. Vertical looked within normal range.- No horizontal particle images for duration of flight.
- Blew out ADIFR and QCR Pressure Lines in Radome
- No SATCOM Status Lights at ADS rack for majority of warmup time. came on 20 minutes prior to takeoff. Likely a satellite coverage issue.

Flight:


1957 - reset of USHAS
~1958 - cloud pass
2000 - PLWC dropped to -0.35 W. Josh suspects a bad heating element.
2015 - power cycled 2DS with no change to horizontal channel. still not producing images.
2020 - power cycled anti-ice breaker for PLWC (LWOO) without result.
2132 - reset of USHAS
0238 - DPR entered service mirror mode. Reset DPR.

Landing: 01:07

Pre-Flight:
Right Dew Pointer entered service mirror state prior to takeoff. No action taken.

Flight:
18:52 Power Cycled DPR due to a flooded mirror.
21:33 - reset USHAS
21:41 - reset USHAS
