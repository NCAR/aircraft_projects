Changes to the control page: 
added 'chrony logs' to monitor clocks on individual dsms. Very large numbers are bad, numbers becoming smaller near the (re)startup of a DSM are normal. The chrony tracking log on each dsm has one actual record for every 10 or so seconds. So the blinking red 0's can be ignored, and only the one record/10 seconds should be used for determining time slew.

Preflight: No cameras for flight, Chris says is not software.
CPC@L1 is nan, Adriana says because pump not on. Otherwise, all other vars look good.

1530Z	Wheels Up
1557Z	Cycled cameras off and on by icon per Dave Allbee, cameras are back.
1629Z	VCSEL power cycled per Mike Reeves
1835Z	pilots report we are under cloud 
1841Z	Cloud edge, checking instruments, corrected temp equals corrected DP.
1853Z	CDP and PCASP show good histograms in cloud. 2DC has good end diode voltages and concentrations, will take no action.
1900Z	Cloud edge, ATX=DPR
1905Z	2DC images working. CDP and PCASP histograms good too.
1923Z	cloud edge, ATX=DPx, all cloud probes firing.

Takeoff: 17:00
Landing: 21:17
No camera today.  Waiting on new window.

VCSEL not happy today.  Stuart reports housekeeping data is corrupted but the 25 Hz data is OK. Need to test different grounding techniques on the ground. Possibly swapping out the original 25 Hz EEPROM.

DPL started oscillating around 18:58.  Time for a cleaning.

VCSEL removed pre-flight
Cleaned DPL & DPR pre-flight
Still no fwd camera 
Takeoff delayed 2 hours for better clouds

2054 Takeoff

DPR (blue light off) oscillating more than DPL

2144 GNI locked-up, turned off for duration of flight

Need to look at/test L-3 headset

Preflight:
All vars look good. GNI instrument breaker fallen inside box with jam nut pressed into paint, comes off with light pressure. Repaired prior to takeoff. After repair, applied power to box and checked variables with no other actions.

1356Z	Wheels Up
1358Z	Camera started
1358Z	restart VCSEL
1418Z	restart VCSEL
1435Z	Beginning descent to boundry layer.

1542Z	Landing, Wichita Falls, TX
1705Z	Cycle power, DPR
1743Z	Wheels Up, Wichita Falls
1823Z	Per request from ground, In flight mod of VCSEL install, black grounding wire disconnected from body of VCSEL and stowed, VCSEL restarted
1919Z	cloud edge, ATX=DPXC, CDP and PCASP show histograms, 2DC shows shadowgraphs.
2002Z	Restart camera
2005Z	restart camera again
2009Z	restart camera again
2014Z	Spontaneous reboot of ADS computer. On completion of reboot, restarted Data Aquisition. Nimbus would not stay running. Reboot ADS computer using power icon. Data Collection starts. CVI rack lost power. Troubleshoot to CVI flow controller box. Took fuses out of back, visual inspection okay, reinserted fuse pack. CVI starts. Possible causes: crud on fuses or fuses needed reseated bedause of vibration.
2116Z	Had been advised to try restart of VCSEL when DP was about -30C. Tried restart. Still nan

Takeoff: 19:59
Landing 23:30

Preflight:
18:28 - Had to restart Data Aquisition after being locked out of Desktop. Attempted to run A2D auto cal and encountered a nidas error. When looking into error, encountered a bug report screen upon exiting out of error reporting splash screen lost all mouse and keyboard abilities within desktop and and applications. 


Flight:

-21:45	Encountered heavy turbulence causing a retaining cotter pin to come free from the CCN inlet cover plate. Re-installed once flight had leveled off.
 

-VCSEL had numerous dropouts of DP_VXL throughout flight for durations ranging from a few seconds to several minutes.

Flight notes

1909 28 V AI turned on late
1912 Vcsel not reporting.  Resetting. Reset did not help.
1927 DPL is cycling.  Will try a restart.
1933 DPL seems to be lost. Maybe clean before next flight.
1944 DPR and DPL both seem be wandering.  They need to be looked at.
1952 DPR started working on decent.  Not sure what was going on at 23K. VCSEL is still in and out.
1956 reset VCSEL per Reeves.
2017 VCSEL reset again no laser intensity.
2202 something happens to RTF1 and it stops tracking the other temps.  There was a small icing event at that time.
2209 Iced QCR
2217 QCR recovers.
