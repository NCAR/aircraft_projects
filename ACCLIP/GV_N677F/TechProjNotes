Seeing lots of noise and long vertical streaks in both 2DS channels. Performed different masking techniques, laser power adjustments, and disabled the TX/RX arm heaters. Nothing seemed to make it better and it took a whopping 46GB of data in approximately 5 hours of running.

Takeoff: 18:48
Landing:

Zero noise on the 2DS preflight. Not recording this flight due to the amount of data but am running to monitor and activate the heaters. At 20:06 and 01:50, the VNC connection to 2DS mysteriously disconnected. On a positive note, we still get particles when detected.

Momentarily lost satcom at 00:25. Switched from the Americas satellite to the Asia-Pacific satellite.

Unable to connect to 2DS during pre-flight. All values for network and probe were reset and still would not connect after updating all of these values. After extensive troubleshooting, Josh loaded an older configuration file and we were able to collect ground data after that.

SATCOM intermittently cut out on the ground, likely due to military aircraft activity.

NO2 Ozone instrument computer froze in-flight and had to be shut down. TOGA also inop for entire flight, likely due to excessive moisture in lines.

At 0259, Right TEMP-DACQ lost connection (RTH1, RTH2, CAVP_DPL, CAVP_DPR), as well as some associated values for ambient temp, wind, ATX. Reset Nose DSM breaker and restarted Nimbus, which brought back some of the values on Aeros. Right TEMP-DACQ will still need to be replaced with spare.

Excessive moisture/condensation formed on inlets during quick descent from 38000ft down to 15000ft and lower towards Jeju Island.

At 0633, after descending to Jeju Island, RTH1, RTH2, CAVP_DPL and CAVP_DPR all reading values - so right TEMP-DACQ seems to be back online. 

Left Hygrometer in re-balance state after last ascent to 16000.

Excessive noise in 2DS data when unmasked and going through clean air.

Cleaned VXCEL, CDP, 2DS before flight.
Removed and cleaned Right Dewpointer before fligh (due to service mirror light flashing red).

Exessive noise on 2DS, especially during ascent, appears to be getting worse.

Mission scientist reported that RIC was delayed by 30sec.

UHSAS lost connection in flight. Unable to ping using "cat/ etc/hosts" in terminal window
