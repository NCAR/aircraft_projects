SP2 leak. Shuka requested closing all valves.

MTP not sending info to ground. Restarted with help of Teresa.

Right dewpointer intermittently lost connection (showing -32676) and started showing data again.

Seeing lots of noise and long vertical streaks in both 2DS channels. Performed different masking techniques, laser power adjustments, and disabled the TX/RX arm heaters. Nothing seemed to make it better and it took a whopping 46GB of data in approximately 5 hours of running.

Takeoff: 18:48
Landing:

Zero noise on the 2DS preflight. Not recording this flight due to the amount of data but am running to monitor and activate the heaters. At 20:06 and 01:50, the VNC connection to 2DS mysteriously disconnected. On a positive note, we still get particles when detected. 

Josh temp test:

Momentarily lost satcom at 00:25. Switched from the Americas satellite to the Asia-Pacific satellite.

Tech: Ivana

Unable to connect to 2DS during pre-flight. All values for network and probe were reset and still would not connect after updating all of these values. After extensive troubleshooting, Josh loaded an older configuration file and we were able to collect ground data after that.

SATCOM intermittently cut out on the ground, likely due to military aircraft activity.

NO2 Ozone instrument computer froze in-flight and had to be shut down. TOGA also inop for entire flight, likely due to excessive moisture in lines.

At 0259, Right TEMP-DACQ lost connection (RTH1, RTH2, CAVP_DPL, CAVP_DPR), as well as some associated values for ambient temp, wind, ATX. Reset Nose DSM breaker and restarted Nimbus, which brought back some of the values on Aeros. Right TEMP-DACQ will still need to be replaced with spare.

Excessive moisture/condensation formed on inlets during quick descent from 38000ft down to 15000ft and lower towards Jeju Island.

At 0633, after descending to Jeju Island, RTH1, RTH2, CAVP_DPL and CAVP_DPR all reading values - so right TEMP-DACQ seems to be back online. 

Left Hygrometer in re-balance state after last ascent to 16000.

Excessive noise in 2DS data when unmasked and going through clean air.

Tech: Ivana

Cleaned VXCEL, CDP, 2DS before flight.
Removed and cleaned Right Dewpointer before flight (due to service mirror light flashing red).

Exessive noise on 2DS, especially during ascent, appears to be getting worse.

Mission scientist reported that RIC was delayed by 30sec.

UHSAS lost connection in flight. Unable to ping using "cat/ etc/hosts" in terminal window

Tech: Ivana

Forward camera did not work at startup. Stopping cameras and starting cameras again did not resolve the issue. Used a script that Catherine prepared to change camera feed going to ground from forward to right camera (/home/local/projects/scripts: python MissionControl.py).

Dewpointers re-balanced after -50.

2DS H channel noisy - masking H channel caused V channel to be noisy as well. Masked in clear air for duration of flight. H laser temp fluctuated +/- 5 degrees C while V laser temps fluctuated +/- 10 degrees C. After removing masks from both channels before flying in clouds again, only H channel picked up cloud particles while V channel picked up noise.

-2DS Arm heaters disabled after take-off
-SP2 not seeing data, asked to check network connection cables. Instrument re-start resolved issue. 
-Swagelock on TOGA's cylinder came loose. Eric confirmed not an issue and re-attached.
-0247: Satcom down in-flight for extended period, even though SDU and SBU available lights still green. Pilots cycled SATCOM button which did not resolve issue. Reseting circuit breaker in cockpit did not resolve issue. Pilots called Pavel using SAT phone to check in.
-During final descent to Osan, onboard cameras lost connection and re-start did not resolve issue. Terminal window read:

"libdc1394 error: juju: Max retries for tcode 0x4, offset f00600

libdc1394 error: Generic failure: in dc1394_video_get_framerate (control.c, line 634): Could not get video framerate

Failed to initialize camera with guid b09d0100537b6e"

-During final descent, Status Page showed all components were red Critical (except for chrony logs) for about 30 seconds. Aeros data still reading normally. Status page components green again after ~30 seconds.

-2DS Arm Heaters disabled for flight
-Rain during pre-flight and take-off, likely contributing to noise on 2DS.
-Restarted vcsel right before takeoff
-0213: Camera images stopped updating. Status page showing "Critical Stopped". Catherine advised that it would require ac server reboot to possibly fix, which we don't want to do in-flight.
