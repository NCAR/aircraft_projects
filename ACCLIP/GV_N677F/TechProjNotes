Seeing lots of noise and long vertical streaks in both 2DS channels. Performed different masking techniques, laser power adjustments, and disabled the TX/RX arm heaters. Nothing seemed to make it better and it took a whopping 46GB of data in approximately 5 hours of running.

Zero noise on the 2DS preflight. Not recording this flight due to the amount of data but am running to monitor and activate the heaters. At 20:06 and 01:50, the VNC connection to 2DS mysteriously disconnected. On a positive note, we still get particles when detected.
