Some interesting tests:

Iridium:
    mtu/mru: currently using mtu,mru=296
        Do we get higher throughput with larger values?
    bsdcomp,deflate,vj: any benefits to compression?
        what gets negotiated currently?
        Some internet documents suggest not using PPP compression over iridium
            because of the large error rate.
        My understanding of VJ header compression (rfc1144) is that it
            should recover from errors much easier than the general
            packet data compression algorithms. It simply doesn't send
            repeated parts of the 40-byte TCP header, or sends 1 byte deltas
            of fields that typically just change by one (sequence counters).

    passive: use it? (KU used it with multilink to Greenland)

    Test modem compression/error settings?

    The CISL Level 3 doc
    https://www.cisl.ucar.edu/nets/internal/docs/ras/level_3_ras.html
        doesn't have any info on compression

    Test direct internet?

        2) the "AT+cbst=71,0,1" line is crucial
        (3) the 008816000025 (changed from 008816000023 in versions of this
            document prior to 26 Jan 2006) is an undocumented Iridium gateway number
            that allows you to connect without having to specify a password and
            username (this speeds up the connection). An alternative is to use
            008816000022, in which case you have two options: Password is "password"
            and Username is your Iridium telephone number, or, Password and Username
            are both "directinternet".

MPDS:
    does disabling default-asyncmap help?
    passive: use it?
    bsdcomp,deflate,vj: any benefits to compression?
        what gets negotiated currently?
