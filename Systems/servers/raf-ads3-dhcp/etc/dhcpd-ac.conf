# host entries must have different hostnames (the field after "host")

# So if we have two systems that should have the same dns name on
# each aircraft, like "fwdcam", but have different MAC addresses,
# they can both be configured here with different names in the host xxx {}
# declaration, like fwdcam-gv and fwdcam-c130, but the same value for
# ddns-hostname and the same value for option host-name.
# This may reduce the need for different dhcpd configs on each plane.
