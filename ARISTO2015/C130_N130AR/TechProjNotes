Auto cal having issues.  But did find that DSM 324 A/D 0 S/N 1606 had bad channel 4.  1V input gives about 0V output but 4V gives 5V.  This is true for both Auto cal and voltage box inputs.  Moving signals to channel 6.
Suspect that auto cal was having issues because a channel was not working on 1V????
Results of Autocal:
DSM 318 A/D 001 Ch 4 8mv, Ch 7 6mv
DSM 321 A/D 008 Ch 4 8mv, Ch 5 12mv, Ch6 6mv
DSM 324 A/D 1606 Ch 0 6mv, Ch 1 10mv, Ch 3 10mv (replace card after the project due to this and above).

flight rf01
preflight, installed CN, net cable to POE for Valco, fixed a number of loose fasterners and stuff like that.  About 10 min late for CIMS issues.

1709 BO
1716 TO

During flight:
RW DSM would not boot after power transfer.  In flight left it OFF for about 15 min at 20K and then it booted.  Cmigits would not initialize and it should have been able to do that in flight.
SID had issues with IP address, might request an monitor in that rack.
Radar Alt was on late, should maybe turn on before taxi?
Had issue with a number of vairables that were linked to an unheated temp probe that was in the header but not on the plane.  Had to restart nimbus to correct issue.
Saw data on CDP and 2DC.  RW probes were off until 1800.

1842 Matt lost something with LAMS and the OP1 went out (NAN) for about 2 minutes.  Nothing we did here to fix anything.

1848 Saw data both 2DC probes.

1923 Radar Altimeter display not functioning but it reports to the data system.

Replaced RWP DSM 325 power switch.

DSM 321 A0 stopped 19:22 to 19:52.  Reboot fixed it.

ARISTO RF 02

Takeoff: 17:02
Landing:  20:35

Preflight 14:55, DSM 321 A0 analog card failed.  Reboot fixed it.

Cockpit is without Internet this flight.  Chris W. is aware.

17:57 pwr cycle LWP for SID2 probe.

Had to power cycle LWP again to get 2DC to communicate.  When we did that, we lost the PLWC. May be coincidental because I think PLWC is 28VAI.  Turns out we lost LW 2DC-25 data for about 45 minutes.  It was communicating but no concentrations.  Cycled power 2 more times and it finally came back.

LAMS UDP packet dropped out a few times during flight.  Chris W. is aware.

CN plate had flow issues the whole flight.  Mike R. is aware.  CN stable ~ 18:30.

Saw returns from all probes at some point during flight.  

DSM 321 A0 analog card worked the whole flight.

EK replaced LW PLWC
