PREDICT camera images were processed to create movies with flight track animations. The general workflow is:

1) Create mp4 movies in the normal manner, with the northeast quadrant blank.
2) Trim the flight netcdf files to the start and end times of camera image acquisition
3) Execute the dropsonde_wrangler.py script to extract the drop coordinates.
4) Update the flightTrackAnim.py file with flight specific information, including dropsonde locations and input filename.
5) Execute the flightTrackAnim.py script
5) Execute the ffmpeg_combination.py script.
