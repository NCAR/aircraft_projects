[GMT 04/06/06 17:15:22] <Adair_N2UW> 146 second pass at 17:14:38.
[GMT 04/06/06 17:15:50] <JeffStith-Jeffco> hey jim.   Watched the bird lift off and am following its progress
[GMT 04/06/06 17:18:16] <JorgenJensen-GV> G'day Jeff, all well sofar on HIAPER. I am checking the variables and Al is coaching Vanda.
[GMT 04/06/06 17:20:33] <JimMoore-Ops> JeffStith-Jeffco, JorgenJensen-GV , Had a bit of a crisis here as some local poloticians thought the aircraft was a B-747 and therefore would reduce the Bishop runway to rubble when it landed this PM.  That comes from the airport manager who said that is what happens when engineers  get involved with aviation.
[GMT 04/06/06 17:21:57] <JeffStith-Jeffco> Jim,  Gosh, I'm sure Bob will have a soft landing that will only improve the runway conditions at said airport
[GMT 04/06/06 17:22:25] <Adair_N2UW> Ops, Beginning second leg t 17:22.
[GMT 04/06/06 17:23:06] <JeffStith-Jeffco> Jorgen, I'll be out mid-day but back this afternoon, if you need local weather update. 
[GMT 04/06/06 17:23:29] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, All is well now as you know.  I met with the airport manager and he suggested a parking spot that would be a bit out of the way (not directly in front of the  'temrinal') but allow people access when the crowds arrive to view the bird
[GMT 04/06/06 17:24:17] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, Thanks to Jeff and Jim. We will be directed there, I assume, when we land.
[GMT 04/06/06 17:24:42] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, SUggestion from Manager was to have aircraft contact ground on 123.0 and they will direct the aircraft to the proper spot
[GMT 04/06/06 17:25:26] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, I will pass that to the pilots. Thanks.

The question is, will KA be ready early, or should we try to do a bit of stratosphere work before commencing the intercomparison?
[GMT 04/06/06 18:02:39] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, Jan, Both Denise and the Director of WMRS, John Smiley, will attend this PM
[GMT 04/06/06 18:02:54] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK - good.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:03:09] <Adair_n2uw> GV, Early arrival will be fine. We will be done with the 146 in about 10 minutes.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:05:00] <Adair_n2uw> Ops, 146 passed off left wing at 18:04:23. Wind was 314 at 18 m/s.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:05:08] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, we will do an early intercomparison with KA. If we finish that early, then maybe we could attempt a photo op with the KA before departing 2508?
[GMT 04/06/06 18:07:32] <Adair_n2uw> GV, Sounds good.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:09:36] <Adair_n2uw> Ops, 146 off left wing t 18:09:07. Wind 306 at 18 m/s.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:10:27] <JorgenJensen-GV> Let's discuss that towards the end of the intercomparison. Alternatively we could do another racetrack at a different altitude for science purposes. TBD after discussion with Vanda.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:11:08] <Adair_n2uw> Ops, End of leg 4 was 18:10:15. FL 180.

[GMT 04/06/06 18:29:10] <JDoyle-Ops> Vanda:  We've analyzed the 12z models now.  It looks like the event is too southerly Friday afternoon and becomes a little more westerly after a shortwave passage on Saturday morning.  The max waves in COAMPS (fcst goes through 12Z Sat) is between 06-12Z Saturday.  Looking at the NAM and GFS and COAMPS there might be a moisture problem before the trough, but after passage Sat am it dries out.  The flow is weaker at ridge level, but more westerly and pr
[GMT 04/06/06 18:29:10] <JDoyle-Ops> obably conducive to waves.   We are thinking of beginning the IOP at 06Z on Saturday and to concentrate on Saturday.  Sunday is complicated with moisture coming in by 18Z and flow a bit more uncertain.  Because of sounding constraints with Lemoore, we can't get any soundings beyond 02Z on Sunday.  Lemoore is not available until 1300 PDT Sunday (according to a recent email).
[GMT 04/06/06 18:30:08] <Adair_n2uw> Ops, KA started leg 1 at 18:29:30. FL 220.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:37:06] <Adair_n2uw> Ops, HIAPER passed left wing of KA at 18:36:08. FL 220. Wind 298/24.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:37:12] <Vanda-HIAPER> I agree with your analysis. Friday is too southerly, so starting at 06 UTC to obtain sounding for morning Saturday flights is fine (we just passed King Air!).

[GMT 04/06/06 20:12:09] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, As I understand it,  BAe will be at the point at the time on the mission brief from this morning.  Their sat phone is not operational a this time.
[GMT 04/06/06 20:12:28] <JorgenJensen-GV> Thanks, understand
[GMT 04/06/06 20:14:44] <BrianBillings-bishop> The latest RUC forecast shows the 700 mb moisture makes little southward progress over the next 3 hours. Therefore, the planned flight levels should be relatively clear.
[GMT 04/06/06 20:16:01] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, Position report for BAe from  6 minutes ago-- 2010 UTC 36°24.7N	     	121°00.0W	     	 19800  (SW bound out of Fresno toward the coast)
[GMT 04/06/06 20:18:52] <JorgenJensen-GV> Thanks, Jim. I have relayed to Henry.

[GMT 04/06/06 20:36:08] <BrianBillings-bishop> In case anyone didn't get my earlier message, the latest RUC forecast shows the 700 mb moisture staying where it is for the next three hours, so there should just be low stratocumulus and maybe high cirrus just west of Monterey.

[GMT 04/06/06 21:24:17] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim - Jorgen tells me we will be 20 to 30 minutes late. 
[GMT 04/06/06 21:26:43] <laptop4-g5> We are having 2/8 SrCu, rthere should be no problems finding a 'hole' to descent to 1000 ft. Of course, I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:31:19] <laptop4-g5> We have had perfect intercomparison conditions both over land and here.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:33:39] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim Doyle - This is a message from Joach. He says that he likes your flight scientists report from Mar 25 very much.

[GMT 04/06/06 21:35:48] <JDoyle-Ops> We have debriefed the KingAir and their intercomparison with the Hiaper and 146 was very successful as well.  Apparently good photos and video were taken too.

[GMT 04/06/06 22:45:34] <JorgenJensen-GV> Jim, I was just told of the desire to do a low overpass at Bishop; my understanding was that we would do that on the Clay Lacy flight, not this one. Pleas inform Geoff Haines-Styles that we have no plans for a low pass at this point. Besides, we are already late. Thanks, Jorgen
[GMT 04/06/06 22:45:52] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, We will head over to the airport now--see you on the ground
