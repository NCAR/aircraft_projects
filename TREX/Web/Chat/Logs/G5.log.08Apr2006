[GMT 04/08/06 12:17:37] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, perfect!  can't get Aeros up yet since not sure how to connect, can you tell me what current counts are?
[GMT 04/08/06 12:18:54] <TCampos-GV> ilana, cps: 80-90 kcps.  You've built a very nice instrument, my friend. (kudos to other AON members, too, of course.)
[GMT 04/08/06 12:19:27] <TCampos-GV> ilana,  chris will correct me if i'm wrong but iirc, in aeros you connect to rt-ground.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:20:19] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, excellent!  that should be about 62 ppb...and hopefully climbing with altitude
[GMT 04/08/06 12:20:57] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yeah, it's looking good.  Just hitting 90 ppbv now.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:21:59] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, very good you should be all set.  All you will need to do now is zero every now and again, otherwise enjoy the flight.  Hope you get a good snooze or two in there!
[GMT 04/08/06 12:22:41] <ChrisWebster> TCampos-GV doesn't matter.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:22:50] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, what server should I connect to while on ground?
[GMT 04/08/06 12:22:50] <TCampos-GV> ilana, thanks, chief.  Hope you have a nice time on the ground, too.  I'm definitely napping a bit--in 10 minute snatches, of course!
[GMT 04/08/06 12:23:08] <TCampos-GV> ilana, i think it's orion.atd.ucar.edu for the gv.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:25:22] <ilana-jeffco> ah okay then I just tried that and O3 and CO channels looks wierd but data may not be all there yet.  Also noticed that not all data channels are displayed when selecting traces to plot and some channel names are different, so not sure if I'm just doing it wrong of if no data collection
[GMT 04/08/06 12:26:08] <TCampos-GV> ilana, maybe orion is the machine for the c-130.  You can tell if there is a variable for xrtno, and one for noy.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:26:48] <ilana-jeffco> yup that's what it is...know what server name I should use for GV then?
[GMT 04/08/06 12:27:32] <TCampos-GV> no, when the c130 was in mexico, the c130 machine name was sloop.atd.ucar.edu.  Maybe try that one???
[GMT 04/08/06 12:27:36] <ChrisWebster> sloop is the gv computer.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:28:19] <ilana-jeffco> ah very nice, got it now...thanks guys
[GMT 04/08/06 12:28:20] <TCampos-GV> chris, thanks for setting us straight.  I was just confused.... Sloop was also the gv machine name during MIRAGE.
[GMT 04/08/06 12:29:55] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, things are looking great!  I see you just did a zero mode too...very nice!
[GMT 04/08/06 12:30:14] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, really nicely following theta today

[GMT 04/08/06 14:17:46] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yeah, things are quite lovely out here.  It's very interesting to notice a lag between theta and wi during these wave events.  lag ~ 15-30 sec.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:19:30] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, yeah true...thanks for pointing that out...what do you think it means...time delayed response in an instrument? or atmopsheric significance
[GMT 04/08/06 14:20:08] <TCampos-GV> chris or johnW, does the 'save png' function work on aeros?
[GMT 04/08/06 14:20:27] <TCampos-GV> chris/johnW: btw, i'm at a windows machine.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:21:18] <TCampos-GV> ilana, initially i suspected instrument delays, but seem to have seen at least one instance of clear anti-corr w/ no lag....
[GMT 04/08/06 14:22:33] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Ilana: That is atmospheric. What goes up, must come down. Updraft waves should be 90 degrees out of phase with theta fields; try to sketch on an envelope.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:23:24] <wasinger-jeffco> TCampos-GV, Alt-PrntScrn would take a snapshot in windows...  then just paste into MS Paint.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:23:51] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, huh...wierd...btw, jorgen and I had a very nice discussion at Cafe sole this morning.  Would like to share thoughts with you when we get a chance when you are on the ground.  He had some new insights into the RF05 spike that seem to make a bit more sense.  I am going to plot up a few things to discsuss some more, then back to you in  a bit.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:24:05] <wasinger-jeffco> TCampos-GV, I don't recall if its Ctrl- or Alt- though...
[GMT 04/08/06 14:24:09] <TCampos-GV> johnW:  Doh.  I actually knew that one, but thanks for reminding me in time to get a photo of this racetrack!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:25:41] <TCampos-GV> ilana, cool.  Looking forward to catching up, especially when the topic is science!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:27:19] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, jorgen and I just discussed WI vs. theta and conclusion is that it should be 45 degrees offset, just as it is...so all good

[GMT 04/08/06 14:30:38] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, what?  anyway, we are reconsidering 45 vs. 90 degree offset...
[GMT 04/08/06 14:32:44] <Jcowan-Jeffco> It might blink for a while Ta.  Give it about 5 minutes or so.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:33:36] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Also look for a veriable that does CN status and put it in a list.  The value should be 0 if the CN is happy.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:34:50] <Jcowan-Jeffco> ads-gv, Ta, you are also to high for the CN to work well.  I would wait until you get lower (below about say 35K) before you worry to mich about it.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:35:09] Action: ChrisWebster is away: cell=303-229-5926
[GMT 04/08/06 14:35:51] <ads-gv> Yes!The value show 0 now on my ascii list
[GMT 04/08/06 14:36:39] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay if that is 0 then the CN is fine for now.  Did the light stop blinking?
[GMT 04/08/06 14:37:25] <ads-gv> No!

[GMT 04/08/06 14:41:52] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, oh, I get it now...the check thing that is...I have even had coffee this morning and I'm still super slow!  Ha ha!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:42:33] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, this is some crazy awesome data today...I am very excited about this wave activity and the O3 profile with it...very cool for our purposes!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:42:34] <TCampos-GV> ilana, lol
[GMT 04/08/06 14:43:02] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yes it is super satisfying.  
[GMT 04/08/06 14:43:32] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  the CO and h2o are right there with it too...what a great day for science for this project...I think you are the lucky charm!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:44:26] <TCampos-GV> ilana, I am saving screen shots of the data, 1 per racetrack.  This includes time series of our parameters of interest, plus a trackplot with o3 colorbar.  We'll download them post-flight.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:44:46] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, wow, just awesome!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:45:25] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  nice O3 profile there on accent...glad to see high levels again today.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:46:14] <TCampos-GV> yeah, i'm madly changing scales to make the screenshot pretty...
[GMT 04/08/06 14:46:59] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  awesome, awesome, awesome! and I was gonna leave to get some more sleep, but I'm too excited to not watch the rest now.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:48:00] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, hope you took that dramamine, looking like a wavy day up there
[GMT 04/08/06 14:48:45] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yessirree, i'm prepared to float.  Looking forward to it somewhat, actually.  
[GMT 04/08/06 14:49:04] <TCampos-GV> ilana, btw, thanks very much for sharing the dramamine...
[GMT 04/08/06 14:49:20] <Jcowan-Jeffco> ads-gv, I talked with Jorgen and he agrees that the CN will not work at 40K.  You will need to be lower before it will function.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:49:53] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, yeah, of course, no problem...we should just keep a stash on the rack or in the drawers near the microwave up there
[GMT 04/08/06 14:50:41] <TCampos-GV> ilana, i'm not wanting to zero during this track until the wave activity diminishes.  how long is the max interval between z's?
[GMT 04/08/06 14:51:36] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, not critical to zero all the time if getting good stuff...mostly like to have at least one zero per altitude since background will primarily be constant but change with alt. 
[GMT 04/08/06 14:52:18] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  sometimes I will zero only once per racetrack (on the turn) so that we get a full loop of data
[GMT 04/08/06 14:52:52] <TCampos-GV> ilana, cool.  Will probably get a chance in the turn, thanks.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:53:23] <TCampos-GV> ilana, o3 looking a bit like a half wave rectifier at this alt...  it's crazy!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:53:33] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, I'm so jealous that I'm not up there with you...what an exciting flight.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:53:48] <TCampos-GV> ilana, wish you were here, too.
[GMT 04/08/06 14:54:09] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  seems to be right there with theat and WI though
[GMT 04/08/06 14:54:25] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, theat = theta...my spelling sucks
[GMT 04/08/06 14:55:16] <TCampos-GV> ilana, check out o3-theta-co corrs from ~ 14:45-14:50
[GMT 04/08/06 14:56:30] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  pretty textbook for the O3/CO correlation, and still seeing that funky trend in theta/O3...nice!
[GMT 04/08/06 14:59:49] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, oh maybe I was still on a larger time window, seeing spikes in O3 now at strat levels sitting on top of a flat corr line, and O3/theta is pretty linear in this time window
[GMT 04/08/06 15:03:25] <ads-gv> J.C Thanks!for the CN information.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:04:32] vinson-bishop (vinson@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:05:30] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, interesting that between 14:15 and 14:25 O3 and theta are corr, then between, 14:45 and 14:50 they are anti
[GMT 04/08/06 15:06:28] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  that's probably what you were getting at all along...I'm just slow. :)
[GMT 04/08/06 15:07:29] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yes, the time series trace shows a second set of small amp o3 peaks growing in that are expected pos corr wi theta, and larger amp o3 peaks are anti.  (Sorry about shorthand.)
[GMT 04/08/06 15:10:30] <TCampos-GV> ilana, interesting transition from 500->700 o3 in the turn at the eastern end.  Missed it in CO due to cal (dang).
[GMT 04/08/06 15:15:04] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  but O3 drop during decent right?  
[GMT 04/08/06 15:15:19] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  should be normal, right?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:15:41] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  oh, do you mean around 14:55?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:17:27] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  interesting that anti corr with theta is happening around the 355 K limit again
[GMT 04/08/06 15:17:59] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yes to all.  sorry, i was taking screen photos again.  gotta stop that...
[GMT 04/08/06 15:18:36] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  no rush, plenty of time, especially for you guys
[GMT 04/08/06 15:21:39] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  seems that O3  peaks at 700 ppb around theta = 360K then has a sharp drop off about that...
[GMT 04/08/06 15:21:58] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  again: about = above...I need sleep
[GMT 04/08/06 15:22:45] <TCampos-GV> ilana, yeah, as you say, high o3 like we saw thursday, but sharp v gradient...
[GMT 04/08/06 15:23:33] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  from RF06 O3 max was 400 ppb at theta max of 340K, then in RF05 O3 peaked near 250 ppb at both 330K and 360 K
[GMT 04/08/06 15:24:07] <TCampos-GV> ilana, have you looked at the o3-co-wi corrs on this low (37k) leg?  o3-co anti-corr, but the wave structure is complex, probably due to the diff between strat and trop correlations between these two tracers.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:27:09] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, hard for me to look at that corr with zeros, but will give it a try
[GMT 04/08/06 15:28:01] <TCampos-GV> ilana, oh yeah.  sorry, i didn't realize you had that limitation.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:30:20] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  yeah just doesn't look right for me, but I can see in the timeseries that O3 and cO look anti, hard to tell WI corr
[GMT 04/08/06 15:32:00] <TCampos-GV> ilana, i see.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:33:30] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, btw: how's sFCP_sierra looking in the V&Q tab?  Are you seeing large fluctuations during wave events?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:34:40] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  can you physically feel the wave events?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:35:48] <TCampos-GV> ilana, sFCP_sierra has < 100mV p-p spikes during wave events, and sometimes we can feel them, but not much in the way of turbulence.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:36:32] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  that's pretty small fluctuations...that is pretty good and normal...very very nice!
[GMT 04/08/06 15:37:17] <TCampos-GV> ilana, glad the instrument is behaving nicely.  btw, have you named it yet? (the instrument, that is...)
[GMT 04/08/06 15:37:39] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  oh wait 100mV would be 0.1V, oh well that's not too bad, but not as good as it could be...not critical for these  measurements I don't think
[GMT 04/08/06 15:38:07] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  that is still normal performance for the activity you are seeing though
[GMT 04/08/06 15:39:11] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, no names yet, but while I was going through the frustrastions of constructing the rack a few four letter words came to mind...probably not appropriate for an official name though
[GMT 04/08/06 15:39:41] <TCampos-GV> ilana, they are probably more like 50mv p-p.  I left things on a fairly expanded scale and took a conservative estimate.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:40:09] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  oh good, that's more like what I was expecting...very good then
[GMT 04/08/06 15:41:48] <TCampos-GV> ilana, whew.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:42:16] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  eh, the other number wasn't so bad either though...so no worries
[GMT 04/08/06 15:44:37] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  interesting that wave amplitude was biggest at highest altitude...is that to be expected?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:46:03] <TCampos-GV> ilana, for our alts, that could be true.  it will be interesting to compare the amps we see w/ those of the KA.  The KA has seen bigger than us in the past, iirc.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:47:39] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, okay
[GMT 04/08/06 15:48:38] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV, well, sounds like things are going really really well up there, I'm going to go home and get a few hours of sleep, then I'll be back 1 hour or so before landing (so around 2pm, MT)...okay?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:49:09] <TCampos-GV> ilana, great, have a nice rest and thanks very much for hanging with us during the truly exciting part!
[GMT 04/08/06 15:49:29] <TCampos-GV> ilana, ... and for the support of your instrument.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:49:31] <ilana-jeffco> TCampos-GV,  yup, later T...peace out!

Also make sure that when you try and shut it that the small lock handle is up and not to the side.  Once the door is closed properly you should not be able to open it without turning the lock to the up position.

[GMT 04/08/06 20:11:16] <Teresa-G5> Hi ilana, things are going well.  We did the sounding on the way home.  The trop seems to be quite high up now, so the ferry home is already in the troposphere.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:12:08] <ipollack> Teresa-G5, okay, sounds good I guess...seems like a big difference from thursday though.  Is aeros still working...I don't think it is updating down here.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:12:40] <Teresa-G5> yeah, we're woking.  Er, that's working.  Wish we were woking...
[GMT 04/08/06 20:13:50] <ipollack> Teresa-G5,  kinda hard to wok in the air don't you think?  Anyway, did you hear, no flight tomorrow!
[GMT 04/08/06 20:14:47] <Teresa-G5> yeah, we heard.  happy about that, how about you?
[GMT 04/08/06 20:15:26] <ipollack> Teresa-G5,  of course, want to go kayaking tomorrow...supposed to be a nice and sunny day
[GMT 04/08/06 20:16:32] <AlCooper-GV> Jcowan-Jeffco We're moving fast, pilot's display says ETA 2048 so I'd guess 2100 = 3:00  for landing might be close.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:18:21] <Jcowan-Jeffco> AlCooper-GV, Thanks for the update.  If it gets shorter please let me know.  I do not have a google earth display here.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:20:04] <AlCooper-GV> Jcowan-Jeffco OK, I will.

[GMT 04/08/06 20:21:17] <Teresa-G5> ilana, sorry, I got sidetracked for a few minutes.  I'd love to go kayaking, but...  actually I have a planning meeting tomorrow afternoon for a convection experiment that folks want to propose to fly in a few years.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:22:23] <Teresa-G5> i'm not doing much at the meeting, but could learn a few things :-)
[GMT 04/08/06 20:22:49] <ChrisWebster> Everything go ok?
[GMT 04/08/06 20:23:44] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I think so Chris.  We have not gotten data from them on the ground in 4 hours but everything onboards seems okay.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:26:09] <ipollack> Teresa-G5, okay, well next time then...so I hear that ETA for landing may be in about 40 minutes.  Let me know how NO shutdown goes.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:27:08] <Teresa-G5> ilana, thanks very much.  i'm seriously time zone-challenged, so was just trying to calculate our eta from previous chat entries...  I'll start soon to shut down and appreciate very much your support...
[GMT 04/08/06 20:27:11] <ChrisWebster> Looks like the new Dynamic Hostname didn't re-register at some point...after a dropout.
[GMT 04/08/06 20:28:19] <ads-GV> John! You did got our data send down to ground station on this morning right?
[GMT 04/08/06 20:28:44] <Jcowan-Jeffco> ChrisWebster, Okay, I just thought you would want to knwo.
