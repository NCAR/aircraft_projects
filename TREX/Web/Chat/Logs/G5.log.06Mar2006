[GMT 03/06/06 03:16:34] <ads-GV> Jorgen, if you get a chance plot PLWC and PLWCC on left and ALT_G on right.  Look for corrolations of Alt changes, PLWC bistable state and Alt.  It sure looks to me like PLWCC change with Alt as one would expect and that the bistable stuff with PLWC is also related to altitude.

[GMT 03/06/06 03:35:38] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> That is a flight of 9-10 hours duration, most likely.
