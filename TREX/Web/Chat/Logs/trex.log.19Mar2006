[GMT 03/19/06 18:01:34] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Um, hang on a sec
[GMT 03/19/06 18:02:49] <MarkBradford-Bishop> It's been up almost 72 hours exactly, so must've been Thursday
[GMT 03/19/06 18:07:11] <truss-veracruz> did tghey talk to you about it?
[GMT 03/19/06 18:07:24] <truss-veracruz> are they aware of its importance?
[GMT 03/19/06 18:08:19] <MarkBradford-Bishop> They did talk to me about it, and I okayed it, after impressing upon them its importance; but of all the systems in the room, it was easiest to relocate since it had its own UPS
[GMT 03/19/06 18:08:46] <truss-veracruz> ok thanks
[GMT 03/19/06 18:08:58] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I'm sending Greg e-mail about it
