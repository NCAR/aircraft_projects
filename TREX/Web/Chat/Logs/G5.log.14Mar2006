[GMT 03/14/06 18:06:24] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> The camera computer disconnected about 10:56, rebooted about 11:01. Any ideas why, and could it be related to tdl being off? And can someone check if the diff. GPS computer is still running?
[GMT 03/14/06 18:07:21] <ChrisWebster-GV> It could be related to me accidentally thinking the computer was off and pressing the power button.  :)
[GMT 03/14/06 18:07:59] <ChrisWebster-GV> Then I started it with 503rf03, just restarted it with 503rf04.
[GMT 03/14/06 18:08:46] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Oh. I didn't notice your address was -GV. Enjoy the flight. I started the camera with an 'at' job so it's fine now. So I assume the gps computer above it is running OK?
[GMT 03/14/06 18:09:04] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Whoops, now we probably have it going twice.

[GMT 03/14/06 18:49:27] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Your ISP probably will only send mail for you when you're connected via their network.  I.e., if your IP address isn't one of theirs, they won't send mail for you.
[GMT 03/14/06 18:50:12] <ChrisWebster-GV> So I can only use web-mail stuff?

[GMT 03/14/06 21:52:45] <kurt_RAF> Make sure the drain heater above the galley is on, up above the coffe pot.  Secondly, it's spring loaded, you must hold down the plunger long enough to allow the water to drain.
