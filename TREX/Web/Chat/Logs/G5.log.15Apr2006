[GMT 04/15/06 20:09:44] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  oh, that's great.  I didn't realize that that had been worked out...very very nice.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:10:03] <Teresa-GV> Yes, this is going to be a very nice data set!
[GMT 04/15/06 20:10:37] <Teresa-GV> apparently we're also planning one dropsonde from fl300 on the north leg before the KA begins their runs.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:11:05] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, and likely with good wave activity too...this will be very good for the science we have been discussing
[GMT 04/15/06 20:11:23] <Teresa-GV> ilana, yep.  awesome, eh?
[GMT 04/15/06 20:11:43] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  yes...very actually.  I'm glad that we have the opportunity to get this info.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:11:46] <ads-GV> Jorgen, the flight is going good so far.  No issues.  We did not see anythin on PLWC on the way out.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:13:04] <Teresa-GV> ChrisWebster, I've just noticed (been shown, actually) that you have added MR calcs for the tdl hygrometer.  Thanks very much!
[GMT 04/15/06 20:13:38] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  so I take it that O3 is working well still...from Aeros data it seems that way.  But If you wouldn't mind, maybe you could take a sniff near the crevace in the instrument lid.  I screwed the lid back on so you cannot lift it off, but you can stick you nose close enough in the crack to smell the inside.  I am very sure that there is no problem, but would be re-assuring if you could do so anyway when you get the chance
[GMT 04/15/06 20:14:42] <ads-GV> Jorgen, looks like we might get in some clouds during the sounding.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:15:29] <Teresa-GV> ilana, i don't smell a problem, but then my nose doesn't work very well in CO.  i guess we know enough to say there is no obvious problem, though!
[GMT 04/15/06 20:16:10] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  I can't imagine that there would be...but you know how I worry anyway.  How bout the 2 monitors
[GMT 04/15/06 20:18:44] <Teresa-GV> ilana, not budging above .5
[GMT 04/15/06 20:18:48] <ads-GV> Nope, no clouds. they looked closer then they were.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:19:16] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, okay...very good.  BTW: is it warm onboard?
[GMT 04/15/06 20:19:44] <Teresa-GV> ilana, yes it's warm.  What temp is most critical to monitor?
[GMT 04/15/06 20:21:12] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  CPU and PS in the Watlow tab.  They should be below 38 and 35 respectively.  If needed, I have seen an improvement in equipment temps after asking pilots to decrease cabin temp near the O3 rack  
[GMT 04/15/06 20:21:46] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  Also helps to keep window closed and air conditioninig vent above seat open and pointed toward the floor
[GMT 04/15/06 20:23:11] <Teresa-GV> ilana, will make this request and the shades were already drawn.  But I don't have the eyeball air on.  They are definitely too warm.  Thanks.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:23:40] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  worried now...how warm is too warm?
[GMT 04/15/06 20:25:19] <Teresa-GV> ilana, 1 degree.  The eyeball air is already helping.  Has dropped .3 deg or so already...
[GMT 04/15/06 20:26:09] <Teresa-GV> ilana, that quick drop was for the cpu; the ps is coming down less quickly.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:26:41] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  ack!..okay though...would keep watch of it just in case.  If really gets too warm, like above 42, them might want to consider shutdown.
[GMT 04/15/06 20:27:05] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  normal for cpu to drop quicker than PS since air comes in over cpu and out over ps
[GMT 04/15/06 20:27:22] <Teresa-GV> ilana, thanks for the target.  I'll keep an eagle eye on it, but I think we've caught it in time.

[GMT 04/15/06 20:32:08] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, wow, well that's why things are warm...norm in the past has been 25 or less...so it is pretty warm up there then today, eh?

[GMT 04/15/06 23:19:13] <ilana-jeffco>  Teresa-GV, hi there...I'm back,  again, for a bit.  How's it going?  How are cpu and PS temps?
[GMT 04/15/06 23:21:07] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, hey.  Things are going well.  The temps are ps=32.9, cpu=35.8.  Had to boost cooling twice, but no worries--at least for mid-cabin occupants.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:21:45] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, ahh!  very good!  glad to hear that they are moore normal...hope you guuys aren't freezing now.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:22:17] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, i'm fine, but can't vouch for those rearward.  i imagine they're a little on the cool side.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:22:37] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, I hope errol brought his hat again then
[GMT 04/15/06 23:23:20] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, he's not wearing a hat, but is wearing his headset.  How're things back home?
[GMT 04/15/06 23:24:40] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  so far pretty unexciting at jeffco...we had big dogs for lunch, thenI went to the movies with Meg, now we are going to get dinner.  Otherwise, a run of the mill not-so-sunny saturday.  Things are pretty quiet at Jeffco so not missing much.  
[GMT 04/15/06 23:25:45] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  is it still bumpy up there?  I'm not seeing too much large wave activity on aeros? 
[GMT 04/15/06 23:26:10] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, sounds a lot like things up here.  the flight has been surprisingly (and a bit disappointingly) smooth.  as you've noticed...
[GMT 04/15/06 23:26:28] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  bummer
[GMT 04/15/06 23:26:34] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, the stronger flow seems to be just a smidge north of us.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:26:55] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, and no chance of breaking tracks to get there, eh?
[GMT 04/15/06 23:27:32] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, nope, especially since we can't move the ground infrastructure.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:28:04] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, well at least instrumentation seems to be working well...knock on wood.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:28:22] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, yeah, that's a big relief.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:28:32] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  that was probably not so smart to say...the equipment and murphy probably just heard that
[GMT 04/15/06 23:29:01] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV,  my words that is
[GMT 04/15/06 23:29:03] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, doh!  they have such sensitive ears, too.
[GMT 04/15/06 23:29:13] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, always...ha ha ha
[GMT 04/15/06 23:30:31] <ilana-jeffco> Teresa-GV, well...glad to hear that at least equipment things are going smooth...I'm heading back out again, will be back here at 8 to receive  your arrival...later for now
[GMT 04/15/06 23:31:10] <Teresa-GV> ilana-jeffco, ok.  Have a nice dinner.
