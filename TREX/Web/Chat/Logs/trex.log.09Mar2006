[GMT 03/09/06 21:00:40] <AlCooper-Jeffco> i) there will be no GV (or KA) flight Friday
[GMT 03/09/06 21:00:56] <ronsmith_GV> We are doing our first racetrack at about 4okft.  Big smooth gravity waves with +/- 5m/s vertical speed
[GMT 03/09/06 21:01:04] <AlCooper-Jeffco> ii) Saturday will be a hard down day for the GV and crew
[GMT 03/09/06 21:01:50] <AlCooper-Jeffco> iii) TREX operations will appreciate hearing, when you leave the research area, your ETA for return to Jeffco and the likely time for the post-flight debrief.
[GMT 03/09/06 21:02:57] <AlCooper-Jeffco> iv) There will be a planning meeting tomorrow, and one topic will be to consider any flexibility in the pilot swap day. As of today, Monday looks encouraging (but not great) for a flight day, perhaps better than Tuesday.
