[GMT 04/26/06 18:09:13] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Al Cooper, I am not sure that the calibrations in the aircraft conversion and on the ground are identical; I would not be surprised if there still is some residual changes due to the in-flight maneuvers and the subsequent analysis. I am in the midst of the programming for it.

[GMT 04/26/06 18:15:12] <AlCooper-GV> JorgenJensen-JeffCo Thanks, I hope it's something like that because these variations around the racetrack look pretty suspicious.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:28:54] <JamesDoyle-Ops> N2UW:  Can you give us an update on your location?
[GMT 04/26/06 18:29:54] <N2UW_> We are traversing between Mammoth and dryer. found possible wave structure.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:31:58] <G5-JIANG> Ops: at FL300, near Sierra ridge crest, persistent moderate turbulence experienced with a w spike up to 3.2 m/s.  
[GMT 04/26/06 18:32:14] <JamesDoyle-Ops> AlCooper-GV:  I was looking at the forecast and there is some suggestion of a circulation around 12 or 14 km with southerlies to the south of the valley and more of an easterly component to the north near Bishop.  The winds are weak and there is some suggestion of directional variability with southerlies more likely along the south racetrack.  Not sure if this is completely consistent with what you are seeing.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:36:07] <LauraPan-GV> CO and ozone have been showing very pronounced anticorrelated wave patterns associated with the theta perturbation and turbulence we are having at 300 level
[GMT 04/26/06 18:36:37] <AlCooper-GV> JamesDoyle-Ops That is quite consistent with what we are seeing. It has been such a repeatable pattern that I suspect some flaw in the wind system, but maybe it's real.  This is now the most turbulence we have had all project, I think. 
[GMT 04/26/06 18:37:26] <LauraPan-GV> these are larger in amplitude and more organized than what we have been seeing the whole day
[GMT 04/26/06 18:38:30] <G5-JIANG> I believe we experienced wave breaking just underneath the critical level. 
[GMT 04/26/06 18:39:10] <JamesDoyle-Ops> AlCooper-GV:  Interesting comments about the turbulence.  Might be complicated because of the directional critical level.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:39:41] <JamesDoyle-Ops> G5-JIANG:  Any clouds apparent at 30kft?
[GMT 04/26/06 18:40:20] N2UW__ (UW@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &TREX.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:41:18] <N2UW__> ops: we are on the way home
[GMT 04/26/06 18:42:06] <GregStossmeister-ops> N2UW_, ok. see you in a few - wlecoming party waiting
[GMT 04/26/06 18:42:18] N2UW_ (UW@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 04/26/06 18:42:56] <G5-JIANG> Jim: Not much. We experienced turbulence both to the west of the Sierra ridge and over Independence, likely corresponding to wave excited by the Sierra crest and Inyo mountians.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:43:34] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5-usually CN is anticorrelated with ozone, but at your current altitude, correlation is positive, with similar fine-scale structure, ~18:33-37.

[GMT 04/26/06 18:50:01] <JamesDoyle-Ops> GV:  There are a couple of turbulence reports over the southern Sierra.  One light turbulence report at 37kft.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:51:08] MarkBradford-Boulder (mark@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &TREX.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:51:09] <AlCooper-GV> JamesDoyle-Ops Thanks for the pirep.
[GMT 04/26/06 18:51:59] <LauraPan-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, which var is good to look for CN?
[GMT 04/26/06 18:57:01] <LauraPan-GV> just had a group of very monochromatic peaks of ozone and theta
[GMT 04/26/06 18:59:07] <AlCooper-GV> LauraPan-GV Laura, it's interesting that the ozone and theta traces look fairly sinusoidal while the W trace looks more broken and turbulent. The turbulence doesn't seem to be reflected in O3 or theta.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:03:52] <LauraPan-GV> agreed. this is intersting
[GMT 04/26/06 19:05:00] <G5-JIANG> Pretty good turbulence over Independence again..
[GMT 04/26/06 19:05:37] <LauraPan-GV> this was not the case with the patch of turbulence we just went through - the tracers are not organized
[GMT 04/26/06 19:12:49] <G5-JIANG> Laura & Al, it might be due to the short vertical wavelengths of the breaking waves, which led to more local mixing within a shallow layer.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:18:18] <LauraPan-GV> I am wondering how cloud interfere with the wave propagation from the ridge top - I bet Jim and Qingfang can give me a mini-lecture on this later.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:20:29] <AlCooper-GV> JamesDoyle-Ops Jim, we're thinking of one more racetrack after this, at FL430, then exit north and head home. That's about all the time we'll have. Any other thoughts about perhaps a better level than FL430 to finish?
[GMT 04/26/06 19:29:14] <DaveR-Jeffco> LauraPan-GV, CONCN_WCN (#/cc). 
[GMT 04/26/06 19:31:41] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- CN now anticorrelated with ozone, since ~19:09 when you climbed through trop.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:33:42] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: still an easterly component to the wind here at FL370. It is smooth here, with good short-wavelength waves. 
[GMT 04/26/06 19:34:50] <dickdirks-ops> AlCooper-GV, Finishing one more racetrack sounds good to us.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:35:06] <G5-JIANG> No turbulence along this leg, observed dozens of short-wavelength waves, unlikely directly related to terrain underneath.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:35:22] <G5-JIANG> sorry, a dozen or so, not dozens.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:37:56] <LauraPan-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, I'm looking at var WCN - it seems to have a samll phase shift in its corr with others , more obviously with CO. possible reason?
[GMT 04/26/06 19:38:22] <AlCooper-GV> dickdirks-ops OK, we're climbing to FL430 now, and we're planning more dropsondes over Independence on this last leg. We'll listen for the KA; I know they had a planned T/O at 2000Z, but I think our sondes will be clear of the area before they get there unless they go earlier than that.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:39:04] <dickdirks-ops> AlCooper-GV, Jim agrees with FL430 to finish.  KA will not fly this afternoon.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:39:58] <AlCooper-GV> dickdirks-ops OK, thanks.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:40:28] <LauraPan-GV> just want to comment on the large amplitude wave structure in the ozone data 150ppb for ~5 K theta perturbation at the sme time.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:41:47] ChrisWebster (cjw@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &TREX.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:54:48] <DaveR-Jeffco> LauraPan-GV, I can't see CO here, but note there is a difference in time response of the instruments. CN is ~1-2 sec delay. Teresa or Ilana may know about CO and ozone delays. 
[GMT 04/26/06 19:54:58] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo>  HIAPER pilots: Can you confirm that the aircraft is ready to fly on Friday? We have to pay a deposit if you say the aircreft is OK, and is many thousands. If no current problems, then we will sign the contract. Please confirm.
[GMT 04/26/06 19:56:41] <ilana-GV> hi dave, yup, O3 delay is about 2-3 secs and CO is 8, that would have been my guess for your instrument considering inlet tubing legnths
[GMT 04/26/06 19:57:05] <ilana-GV> so right on!
[GMT 04/26/06 20:01:48] <AlCooper-GV> JorgenJensen-JeffCo Pilots confirm that, pending no problems between here and BJC, aircraft is OK and will be ready to fly Friday. 
[GMT 04/26/06 20:03:26] <DaveR-Jeffco> Ilana-G5, sometime soon, we should look through the data files for some segments with lots of structure so we can estimate these responses -- aircraft exhaust trail, for example. 
[GMT 04/26/06 20:04:39] <ilana-GV> dave, anytime after this week is okay by me

[GMT 04/26/06 20:36:56] <GregStossmeister-ops> AlCooper-GV, Thanks - no flight for you tomorrow if you haven't heard. Only KA tomorrow morning.
[GMT 04/26/06 20:37:39] <ISS-MAPR-Independence> MAPR seeing south-westerlies at low levels and easterlies aloft - we might have a rotor
[GMT 04/26/06 20:38:03] <AlCooper-GV> GregStossmeister-ops OK, thanks. 
[GMT 04/26/06 20:48:30] <dickdirks-ops> AlCooper-GV, Do we have an eta for G-V return and debrief?
[GMT 04/26/06 20:52:39] <AlCooper-GV> dickdirks-ops I think we'll be back at Jeffco at about 3:50 MDT = 2150UTC, unless we have a delay. With taxi etc., we should be ready to debrief by 2215, I hope.
[GMT 04/26/06 20:54:28] <dickdirks-ops> AlCooper-GV, Thanks.
[GMT 04/26/06 21:06:59] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- youch, 47kft on return ferry is likely to be a strong challenge for CN. From this end, I haven't seen it hiccup yet on this flight.
