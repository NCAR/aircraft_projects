[GMT 03/02/06 15:58:37] <Jcowan-Jeffco> My suggestion would be that as long as the system looks like it is taking data that it be left as is.  Tp fix it you will have to REBOOT the ads station.  That would mean no data for at least 5 to 10 minutes and with the time server that might be up to 30 min.  I will check and see what Chris has to say.
[GMT 03/02/06 15:59:02] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> time server won't be affected.

[GMT 03/02/06 21:39:06] <pavel-calgary> I learned that we can feed a signal to Novatel OEM4 to record events, like sonde drops. Might be useful in future flights when processing DGPS, this helps process areas of particular interest better.
