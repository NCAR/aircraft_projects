[GMT 03/05/06 17:21:59] <AG-Bishop> <-- Mark, on Access Grid machine

[GMT 03/05/06 17:37:02] <snorman-fl> chris..catalog is uploaded..
[GMT 03/05/06 17:37:16] <snorman-fl> hi mark...yep, I'm here :-)
[GMT 03/05/06 17:37:49] <AG-Bishop> The RAF folks have requested that any updates to the nowcasts on the catalogs also be sent up to the plane, can we do that?
[GMT 03/05/06 17:37:56] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> snorman-fl: Hi Susan, I have a request for the GV catalog.
[GMT 03/05/06 17:38:02] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Thanks Susan.
[GMT 03/05/06 17:39:01] <snorman-fl> Hi Chris B.,  you rang..
[GMT 03/05/06 17:39:35] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Yep.  Sorry, I'll be a sec...
[GMT 03/05/06 17:40:04] <snorman-fl> Mark, it might take me a while to write the scipt to do it..
[GMT 03/05/06 17:40:34] <AG-Bishop> Is it something I could help with?
[GMT 03/05/06 17:41:43] <AG-Bishop> I'm on the clock already, so if I knew the directory and prefix for sending things to the plane, I could probably hack up a script pretty quickly
[GMT 03/05/06 17:42:15] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Susan, they're going to want the "Daily Reports -> weather nowcast" product to go up to the GV during today's flight and future flights.  Can you put that into the LDM request?
[GMT 03/05/06 17:42:29] <AG-Bishop> Already talking about it, Chris :)
[GMT 03/05/06 17:42:59] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> D'oh.  Sorry, Mark.

[GMT 03/05/06 17:43:09] <AG-Bishop> No problem
[GMT 03/05/06 17:43:10] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> (and Susan)
[GMT 03/05/06 17:43:31] <AG-Bishop> Better to talk redundantly than have it slip through the cracks
[GMT 03/05/06 17:43:44] <snorman-fl> yes
[GMT 03/05/06 17:43:45] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Thanks Susan.
[GMT 03/05/06 17:46:38] <snorman-fl> Mark, today's nowcast is already on the hiaper's catalog
[GMT 03/05/06 17:47:11] <snorman-fl> will they be updating it?
[GMT 03/05/06 17:48:16] <MarkBradford-Bishop> They won't update the one that's there, but there may be additional ones
[GMT 03/05/06 17:48:40] <MarkBradford-Bishop> And the RAF folks have asked to receive updates in flight, if possible
[GMT 03/05/06 17:49:07] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I could easily modify one of my existing scripts that keeps track of which nowcasts have been sent, and FTP any new ones
[GMT 03/05/06 17:49:44] <snorman-fl> what information do you need?
[GMT 03/05/06 17:49:45] <MarkBradford-Bishop> The one tricky bit would be making sure that any relevant images get sent along with the HTML
[GMT 03/05/06 17:50:20] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I need to know how to get files named and placed correctly to get up to the plane
[GMT 03/05/06 17:50:50] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Remind me later to tell you about the other hack I made to the catalog yesterday :)
[GMT 03/05/06 17:52:28] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Mark & Susan, if you can't pull this off today, I recommend a low volume web page on the ground we can browse to.  Then you can tell us via chat when there are updates....
[GMT 03/05/06 17:52:59] <snorman-fl> since you're pulling the files from the catalog, you just need to put a trex_ in front of the name and then put it in the ldm ftp space
[GMT 03/05/06 17:53:33] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Fortunately the nowcast pages are already pretty low-volume, since they don't inline the images
[GMT 03/05/06 17:54:31] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Cool, Susan -- where is the LDM FTP space?  (You can tell me in e-mail if it shouldn't go on the chat)
[GMT 03/05/06 17:56:15] <snorman-fl> I'll email you..
[GMT 03/05/06 17:56:23] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Great, thanks

[GMT 03/05/06 18:02:53] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Got it, thanks.  Turns out the way the images are stored with the nowcasts, it should be pretty straightforward.
[GMT 03/05/06 18:03:24] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Do you happen to know which nowcast is the newest one already on the plane?
[GMT 03/05/06 18:03:59] <snorman-fl> the latest..17:29..
[GMT 03/05/06 18:04:13] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Excellent, thank you

[GMT 03/05/06 18:11:03] <snorman-fl> I just thought of a problem..the image url's embedded in the nowcast html file do not match the plane's catalog url's.  I have a script that I run on the plane that fixes that but if you just transfer the html files "as is" none of the image links will work..does this make sense??
[GMT 03/05/06 18:11:29] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Yes, it does -- I was just thinking about that, in fact.  What's the change that needs to be made?
[GMT 03/05/06 18:12:27] <snorman-fl> instead of /trex/report/weather.... is should be /trex/catalog/report/weather...
[GMT 03/05/06 18:12:38] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Okay, I can fix that with Perl
[GMT 03/05/06 18:12:41] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Thanks!

[GMT 03/05/06 18:57:01] <errol-GV> a lot of the drops transmitted for a while on hte ground and had very sporaadic data then - could this be part of the problem  you had?

[GMT 03/05/06 18:58:28] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> No, it was an issue with AspenQC's translation of the files to netCDF.  A lot of good points were not being used, and in particular most of the altitude data was ignored.  Charlie has fixed things, though.

[GMT 03/05/06 19:48:47] <ads-GV> DaveR, I'm not sure what is up with ATTACK_A, we are gettin AT_A s I know the ADC is working.  You might ask JW about it.
[GMT 03/05/06 19:48:54] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Chris - I found the camera code problem. Can I start it running?
[GMT 03/05/06 19:49:44] <ChrisWebster-GV> Sure, load average is hovering near 1.0 without, I'm just running areos & chat & browser
[GMT 03/05/06 19:51:04] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> OK. According to dave, during the last flight the computer became extremely slow- minutes to do an 'ls | wc'. But I've reduced the processing some so we'll see. If necessary, perhaps you can run aeros on another computer. 
[GMT 03/05/06 19:51:46] <ChrisWebster-GV> ok
[GMT 03/05/06 19:52:51] <ads-GV> Climbuing back up.
[GMT 03/05/06 19:55:19] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Chris - camera process is taking about 35% of cpu, down from 45-50 last flight. IF I'm reading top right it's about 30% idle? Anyway, the camera is running and saving images. If you need to kill my job it's called grabcolor.
[GMT 03/05/06 19:56:27] <ChrisWebster-GV> I won't need to kill it.

[GMT 03/05/06 20:07:58] <ChrisWebster-GV> One computer is near locked up, Isn't Ctrl-Alt-Del suppoesd to bring up a task manager?
[GMT 03/05/06 20:08:39] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Chris - I pulled down one image just to make sure it is all OK, and it is. Still under the clouds? I'm going to disconnect now. If it becomes necessary for some reason, the camera can be started by the script in the camera computer's home directory: "./startCamera 503rf02". I'll still be on chat for a while.
[GMT 03/05/06 20:09:08] <ChrisWebster-GV> What clouds?
[GMT 03/05/06 20:09:37] <ChrisWebster-GV> Just getting near some stratus whispy type stuff...
[GMT 03/05/06 20:10:09] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Out of them, huh? Take a look at /mnt/camera/503rf02/060305-200835.jpg.
[GMT 03/05/06 20:11:42] <ads-GV> Yes Chris it should bring up the task manager.
[GMT 03/05/06 20:11:47] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> Maybe what I was thinking was heavy cloud is actually dark sky behind this cirrus?
[GMT 03/05/06 20:12:15] <StuartBeaton-jeffco> I'm not used to seeing as black a sky as you get at high altitude.
