[GMT 03/28/06 22:53:10] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Sorry, didn't get beeped here.  Is it OK to kill the two IDVs running on idv2?
[GMT 03/28/06 22:53:41] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Absolutely -- they're not even displaying anything
[GMT 03/28/06 22:53:49] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Sorry, just got the e-mail.  Consider 'em dead!
[GMT 03/28/06 22:54:32] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I tried logging out and back in, and even rebooting idv2, but none of that cleared the problem
[GMT 03/28/06 23:01:22] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> MarkBradford-Bishop:  would you mind running IDV on idv2 again, clicking the "Show Details" button, and e-mailing me the details?  I don't seem to be able to run a remote display here because of GLX issues.
[GMT 03/28/06 23:01:37] <MarkBradford-Bishop> All right, stand by
[GMT 03/28/06 23:02:25] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Actually, I would get the details into e-mail by pasting into the &IDV channel, so if you wanted to join that we could eliminate the middleman :)
