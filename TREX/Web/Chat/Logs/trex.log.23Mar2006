[GMT 03/23/06 16:42:09] <BrandonSlaten-Boulder> MarkBradford-Bishop, Morning, how are things.?
[GMT 03/23/06 16:43:36] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Pretty good, Brandon -- back in the office today?
[GMT 03/23/06 16:44:08] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I'm poking at the linux vpn client in an attempt to help debug stuff on Juerg's laptop
[GMT 03/23/06 16:45:00] <BrandonSlaten-Boulder> Yes, but taking it kinda easy.  Working on clearing stuff up before diving in to new stuff.

[GMT 03/23/06 16:45:29] <BrandonSlaten-Boulder> Olla Mike.
[GMT 03/23/06 16:45:44] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Bah, all I seem to have actually accomplished is breaking neko
[GMT 03/23/06 16:46:09] <BrandonSlaten-Boulder> Noone has been using it, so thats OK. :)
[GMT 03/23/06 16:46:25] <MarkBradford-Bishop> True enough
[GMT 03/23/06 16:46:52] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Although I was close to pressing it into service the other day, when rotor was declining to boot.  I think rotor's issue was overheating, so I've propped it up for better circulation.

[GMT 03/23/06 16:58:25] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Ah, found 'em
[GMT 03/23/06 16:58:50] <BrandonSlaten-Boulder> Yes, Good.
[GMT 03/23/06 17:03:36] <MarkBradford-Bishop> bloody thing won't even boot from CD, I'm going to leave it switched off for a while

[GMT 03/23/06 20:46:16] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Daily planning meeting just ended
[GMT 03/23/06 20:46:39] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I assume you're curious about idv1 -- I unplugged it because the network traffic from linus was destroying the Access Grid
[GMT 03/23/06 20:47:14] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Yep, that was it.  I keep forgetting that I need to think an hour in the *other* direction.  
[GMT 03/23/06 20:48:07] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Sorry to be so abrupt, but the meeting was under way so I had to act quickly
[GMT 03/23/06 20:53:00] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> No harm done.  I was checking out some stuff from the Subversion repository here.
[GMT 03/23/06 20:54:28] <MarkBradford-Bishop> It's back on the net
[GMT 03/23/06 20:54:52] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Yep, I'm preparing to hammer the net from there again. :-)
[GMT 03/23/06 20:56:52] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I see it :)
[GMT 03/23/06 21:42:32] <MarkBradford-Bishop> ChrisBurghart-Boulder, still here?
[GMT 03/23/06 21:43:37] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> Yep, I'm here.
[GMT 03/23/06 21:43:50] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Are you on eolsag@eol?
[GMT 03/23/06 21:44:00] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> No, I'm not.
[GMT 03/23/06 21:44:11] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Okay, I'll cc you on some email in a minute
