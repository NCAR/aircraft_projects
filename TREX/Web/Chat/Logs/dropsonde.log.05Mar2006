[GMT 03/05/06 21:57:09] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol - Greg here. Can you give me roughly the lat-lon of Independence-bound sondes when they are at about 20kft? Not now, but in say, an hour and a half? I guess that would be for about every other sonde or so.

[GMT 03/05/06 22:05:56] <errol-GV> hi Greg - have a few minutes here
[GMT 03/05/06 22:07:13] <errol-GV> here are the first 5 sonde locations    -118.262717  36.726760 1762

[GMT 03/05/06 22:09:38] <errol-GV> greg lust use this channel and I will attmept it
[GMT 03/05/06 22:10:16] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Greg's on the phone, Errol, but he should get back to you soon.  Thanks for the data.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:16:01] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol - I'm back and I'll monitor from now on. I'm waiting for the Doppler lidar operator to get in position and I think that will be at about 2230UTC. 
[GMT 03/05/06 22:18:22] <GSPoulos-Independence> When he does get in position I'll let you know. If it is convenient enought to give the 20kft lat/lon that would be great. You wouldn't need to do those that would land far East of the valley. But if you can't tell which would do what very well just do what you can. The key is to send the information as the sonde hits 20kft - after the fact it is too late for the lidar operator to react.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:29:46] <errol-GV> Greg - will be starting to drop in ~ 10 mins
[GMT 03/05/06 22:30:33] <errol-GV> please translate 20000 ft to meters
[GMT 03/05/06 22:32:01] <errol-GV> it is cut and paste so I will start at about 25000
[GMT 03/05/06 22:33:33] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol - good to have you. See messages above when you can. No rush right now. Can you tell which ones will, within reason, hit Independence (I think it is the ones let loose on the Crest)? Let's try 6000 m (that's close enough to 20kft).
[GMT 03/05/06 22:34:29] <errol-GV> just calcculated it 5634 - will use 6000
[GMT 03/05/06 22:37:15] <GSPoulos-Independence> Something is wrong with your conversion - 20kft is 6096m. Anyway, this will put the sonde 5000 m above ground, giving the lidar operator enough time to turn vertical.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:39:17] <GSPoulos-Independence> Maybe we should use 6500 m to start to give me time to call him. 
[GMT 03/05/06 22:41:22] <errol-GV> OK - I tried another conversion and got a bit closer   39.14" = 1M  (not quite right)
[GMT 03/05/06 22:47:05] <MarkBradford-Bishop> 1m=39.37in
[GMT 03/05/06 22:47:30] <errol-GV> thanks

[GMT 03/05/06 22:53:32] <errol-GV> that is the lot, greg
[GMT 03/05/06 22:57:46] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol, it looks to me like the first or second one will hit closest to where we would like. Let me know the lat lon of those first two when they hit (or so). Then we'll figure out which drop is getting closest and use that drop every run, maybe? The idea is to hit the lidar, which is at 118.161W 36.756N
[GMT 03/05/06 23:02:41] <errol-GV> they are all on the ground - locations will follow soon
[GMT 03/05/06 23:03:07] <GSPoulos-Independence> Correction: 118.18W 36.80N
[GMT 03/05/06 23:07:44] <errol-GV> here they are
[GMT 03/05/06 23:07:49] <errol-GV> -118.234923  36.724434  1645.49
[GMT 03/05/06 23:07:51] <errol-GV> -118.147271  36.840513  1153.87

[GMT 03/05/06 23:07:51] <errol-GV> -117.935521  37.082268  1874.85
[GMT 03/05/06 23:08:15] <errol-GV> looks like #2 is the one
[GMT 03/05/06 23:17:21] <GSPoulos-Independence> 10-4. #2 landed 4.9km to the NE and #1 landed 9.5km southwest. If you can launch the 2nd one a bit faster or both of them earlier by a few kilometers of the last location we should bonk the lidar on the head.
[GMT 03/05/06 23:21:58] <GSPoulos-Independence> At your velocity if #2 was launched 25 seconds earlier it would hit the lidar Mr. Bombardier Korn
[GMT 03/05/06 23:31:11] <GSPoulos-Independence> If you get the launch longitude of #2 from the last run you can launch at that longitude minus 0.02 degrees (how good are you?). 
[GMT 03/05/06 23:42:01] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol?
[GMT 03/05/06 23:43:57] <errol-GV> I think I have reach the height of my incompetance
[GMT 03/05/06 23:48:53] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol, you are doing great. Just look at the lon of #2 from the last run and drop 0.02 degrees more (not less), meaning west of the last #2.The dropsondes are dropping at a 45 degree angle to the northeast.
