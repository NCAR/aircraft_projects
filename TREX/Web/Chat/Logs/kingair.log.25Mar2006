[GMT 03/25/06 23:01:28] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Bryan, we are not receiving tracks
[GMT 03/25/06 23:01:33] <MarkBradford-Bishop> How's the flight?
[GMT 03/25/06 23:02:02] <BryanWoods-KingAir> so far has been smooth
[GMT 03/25/06 23:02:37] <BryanWoods-KingAir> takeoff was a little rough and sierras are pretty convective
[GMT 03/25/06 23:02:55] <BryanWoods-KingAir> things look much more exciting to the south near the lake
[GMT 03/25/06 23:04:23] <BryanWoods-KingAir> we are t FL160
[GMT 03/25/06 23:05:18] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Any chance you could get the track updating again?
[GMT 03/25/06 23:08:36] <BryanWoods-KingAir> give us about 2-3 minutes and let us know if you are getting data
[GMT 03/25/06 23:08:50] <BryanWoods-KingAir> were you receiving flight tracks before?
[GMT 03/25/06 23:09:15] <MarkBradford-Bishop> No, but we are now
[GMT 03/25/06 23:09:28] <BryanWoods-KingAir> excellent
[GMT 03/25/06 23:09:54] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Thank you!
[GMT 03/25/06 23:10:47] <BryanWoods-KingAir> you are quite welcome. we had a data system failure when we were on the ground and it must not have come up
