[GMT 02/28/06 22:40:30] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> You at FL?
[GMT 02/28/06 22:40:38] <snorman> yup
[GMT 02/28/06 22:43:11] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I'm here, Susan, what's up?
[GMT 02/28/06 22:44:23] <snorman> I transferred some satellite images up during the hiaper flight and they got corupted..could this be a ldm problem?
[GMT 02/28/06 22:45:49] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I suppose it could be -- are there still copies on the local FTP server?  It's also possible that the receiving process on board the G5 might have done it -- did we ever get to test that before flight?
[GMT 02/28/06 22:47:20] <snorman> we tested it with some idv images and they seemed fine..there are no longer any copies on the local server :-(

[GMT 02/28/06 22:51:09] <snorman> we tested it with some idv images and they seemed fine..there are no longer any copies on the local server however :-(
[GMT 02/28/06 22:52:04] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Hm
[GMT 02/28/06 22:52:16] <MarkBradford-Bishop> What format were the satellite files?  Just images?
[GMT 02/28/06 22:52:33] <snorman> jpg
[GMT 02/28/06 22:53:02] <MarkBradford-Bishop> And how'd you get them onto the FTP server -- NFS, or FTP?
[GMT 02/28/06 22:53:11] <snorman> ftp
[GMT 02/28/06 22:53:27] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Is there any chance the FTP could've been ASCII mode?

[GMT 02/28/06 22:55:04] <snorman> hmmm...that would make sense...let me check into that...thanks!
[GMT 02/28/06 22:55:11] <MarkBradford-Bishop> sure
[GMT 02/28/06 22:56:06] <MarkBradford-Bishop> If it was binary mode after all, then I'd be puzzled -- it would be very interesting to compare one of the corrupt images that reached the plane with the original
[GMT 02/28/06 22:57:34] <snorman> I was using the perl Net::FTP module so I don't know what the default is.  I'll pull the files down as I think they're still on the net..
