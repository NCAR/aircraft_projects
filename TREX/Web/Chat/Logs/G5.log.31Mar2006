[GMT 03/31/06 16:13:30] <snorman-fl1> catalog is synced up and ready to go :-)
[GMT 03/31/06 16:13:42] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Excellent, thank you
[GMT 03/31/06 16:14:16] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Including the database, I assume?  :)
[GMT 03/31/06 16:14:54] <snorman-fl1> yes, I checked and everything is up-to-date
[GMT 03/31/06 16:15:20] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I figured it would be, since you said you automated that bit.  In a little while we'll find out whether they're actually flying today or not.
[GMT 03/31/06 16:16:00] <snorman-fl1> hopefully so..

[GMT 03/31/06 16:18:23] <DataSystem-c130> Hello ADS, are you going to come out and play today also?
[GMT 03/31/06 16:18:43] <ads-GV> maybe...  We haven't heard yet
[GMT 03/31/06 16:20:00] <DataSystem-c130> Yeah that's what i see.  Hey it looks like we are not update GE or ion, is there anything you can do to see why?
[GMT 03/31/06 16:20:21] <ads-GV> we're in the hanger at the moment.  where are you?  --Chris/Kurt
[GMT 03/31/06 16:20:26] <ads-GV> I can look.
[GMT 03/31/06 16:21:39] <DataSystem-c130> Flying north.  Took off at 1000L should arrive at 1415L or so.  Then need to clear customs.
[GMT 03/31/06 16:23:03] <DataSystem-c130> Is Kurt flying today?
[GMT 03/31/06 16:24:15] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Meeting to determine whether the GV flies or not will start in about 5 minutes.  It's pretty cloudy out here, so I wouldn't hold my breath.
[GMT 03/31/06 16:25:48] <ads-GV> kurt is not, Bill Irwin will.
[GMT 03/31/06 16:26:18] <DataSystem-c130> Ah, well hopefuly you will get off today.
