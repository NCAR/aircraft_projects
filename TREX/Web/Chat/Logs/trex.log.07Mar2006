[GMT 03/07/06 19:03:54] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Hey Mark.  Home safe?
[GMT 03/07/06 19:04:12] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Yep, back in the office -- how are things out there?
[GMT 03/07/06 19:04:50] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Quite today, yesterdays Ops pettered out and they are not expecting anything until late Wednesday or Thursday.
[GMT 03/07/06 19:05:03] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Quiet.
[GMT 03/07/06 19:05:38] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I saw the cancellations in the catalog, and I've seen that the chat's been pretty empty
[GMT 03/07/06 19:07:46] <MarkBradford-Boulder> In addition to e-mail, I'll be checking in here, so feel free to holler if there's anything I can help with
[GMT 03/07/06 19:07:57] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> ok

[GMT 03/07/06 22:16:33] <MarkBradford-Boulder> BrandonSlaten-Bishop, is Chris B in the ops center?
[GMT 03/07/06 22:20:04] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> no
[GMT 03/07/06 22:20:28] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> He is sonde hunting today.
[GMT 03/07/06 22:20:40] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Aha, thanks
[GMT 03/07/06 22:21:22] <MarkBradford-Boulder> He has a fresh new crop to choose from, too!

[GMT 03/07/06 22:21:50] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Yes, he made a route plan to try for about 8 or so.
[GMT 03/07/06 22:21:58] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Wow
[GMT 03/07/06 22:22:30] <wasinger-GV> ChrisWebster-Jeffco, there is a non-linearity at 0 volts...
[GMT 03/07/06 22:23:08] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ok, I'll be out in a second.
[GMT 03/07/06 22:23:18] <wasinger-GV> I captured a screen shot of it and placed it in /home/ads/Desktop
[GMT 03/07/06 22:23:41] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> One dropped nearly on the Highway just south of Ind.  Maybe 300 yards off.
[GMT 03/07/06 22:40:21] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Watch the papers for reports of UFOs
