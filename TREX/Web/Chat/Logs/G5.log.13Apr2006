[GMT 04/13/06 14:16:08] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Hey Dave,
[GMT 04/13/06 14:16:15] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Here if you need me.
[GMT 04/13/06 14:20:57] <DaveR-Jeffco> DavidA-ads-G5, I made a small change to WCN so that it injects water more often. Hopefully, this will keep it working above 40kft.  From the ground, I can only see CONCN_WCN concentration, not status flags (SFLCN_WCN), so I may be pestering you during flight to look at flag value. 
[GMT 04/13/06 14:21:32] <DaveR-Jeffco> DavidA-ads-G5, so far, CONCN_WCN looks good.
[GMT 04/13/06 14:34:30] <DavidA-ads-G5> ok DaveR just let me know
[GMT 04/13/06 14:34:48] <DavidA-ads-G5> thanks John Cowan
[GMT 04/13/06 14:35:06] <DavidA-ads-G5> so far all is well!
[GMT 04/13/06 14:37:25] <DavidA-ads-G5> Here is something interesting, I just happened to glance at the ads interface and it had nopps in red, then went back to normal
[GMT 04/13/06 14:37:58] <DavidA-ads-G5> is anyone on the ground seeing any problems

[GMT 04/13/06 14:40:13] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- is ozone instrument running today? Values look wonkers.
[GMT 04/13/06 14:41:55] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5 - okay = dew points, temperatures (except ATHR2), pressures PSXC QCRC QCFC, carbon monoxide
[GMT 04/13/06 14:42:32] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5 - bad values for one of the TDL channels (PP2F_LHS). 
[GMT 04/13/06 14:43:40] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- no obvious response of King hot-wire probe, PLWC
[GMT 04/13/06 14:46:47] <TCampos-Jeffco> Dave Albee, thanks for taking care of my instruments this morning.
[GMT 04/13/06 14:52:52] <wasinger> DavidA-ads-G5, we've noticed the NO1PPS before... the system is fine.
[GMT 04/13/06 14:52:56] <DavidA-ads-G5> you're welcome teresa

[GMT 04/13/06 15:01:44] <Jcowan-Jeffco> DaveR-Jeffco, ATRH2 will not work since TRRH2 does not.  That value is TTHR3
[GMT 04/13/06 15:02:29] <DavidA-ads-G5> Jcowan-Jeffco, tell Greg that I broke another one of his headsets.
[GMT 04/13/06 15:10:04] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- Looks like WCN stopped making good data at 14:58. 
[GMT 04/13/06 15:11:12] <Jcowan-Jeffco> DavidA-ads-G5, Are you serious? I think he had to order a new one.
[GMT 04/13/06 15:11:50] <DavidA-ads-G5> serious
[GMT 04/13/06 15:12:29] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Same way?
[GMT 04/13/06 15:12:37] <DavidA-ads-G5> it may go back together but i am not going to mess with it until we get on the ground
[GMT 04/13/06 15:12:53] <Jcowan-Jeffco> I acree with not messing with it.
[GMT 04/13/06 15:12:57] <Jcowan-Jeffco> agree
[GMT 04/13/06 15:13:12] <DavidA-ads-G5> i don't know any other way than what i did today
[GMT 04/13/06 15:17:30] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Is it broke where the batteries go in or someplace else?\
[GMT 04/13/06 15:18:23] <DavidA-ads-G5> else

[GMT 04/13/06 15:33:11] <Jcowan-Jeffco> On the A/D you fixed yesterday, you just took one of the Bus driver chips?  I keep an inventory on them so I know how many I have for building new boards.
[GMT 04/13/06 15:35:05] <DavidA-ads-G5> you gave me that bag of chips... i used one of those and put the remainder on your desk. whether it was a bus driver, taxi driver or otherwise, i don't know
[GMT 04/13/06 15:38:30] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, thanks.
[GMT 04/13/06 15:46:53] <Jcowan-Jeffco> DavidA-ads-G5, Do you know if that board works now?
[GMT 04/13/06 15:53:01] <kurt-RAF> Dave, the liquid water looks good.  If by chance you get into any cloud take a look at it.

[GMT 04/13/06 18:35:31] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- when you get a chance, can you look a the clear tubing on the WCN and see if there are globs of water?

[GMT 04/13/06 20:06:30] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Bumpy flight todauy?
[GMT 04/13/06 20:06:44] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- wow, great cloud hunting!  I'm looking at the GOES satellite image for Nebraska. You found the only cloud in the state!
[GMT 04/13/06 20:07:48] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- btw, there is a "red flag warning" for Nebraska panhandle and eastern CO, meaning warm, low humidity, strong surface winds, and strong likelihood of bad wildfire if one gets started. 
[GMT 04/13/06 20:13:44] <DavidA-ads-G5> yes john very bumpy
[GMT 04/13/06 20:17:41] <ERROL-G5> Any wild fires at altitude predicted ?
[GMT 04/13/06 20:25:23] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- your sounding shows strong stable layer at 14kft. CN concs are 30k/cc below this layer and 1k above. 
[GMT 04/13/06 20:27:09] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5- turbulence shows huge jump on top of layer. 
[GMT 04/13/06 20:31:17] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5 - on second look, large TKE is artifact from using GPS wind, which shows momentary jump. IRS wind is smoother. 
[GMT 04/13/06 20:33:12] <JorgenJensen-GV> Nice flight - up here. It was quite turbulent below the investion, much better at 17.5 and 30kft.
