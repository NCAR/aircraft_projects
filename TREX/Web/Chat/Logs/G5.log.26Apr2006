[GMT 04/26/06 14:09:05] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Jeffco, hi there, do you have a chance to check out aeros?  Can you check CO progress?
[GMT 04/26/06 14:10:06] <TCampos-SeaOps> Hi Ilana!  unfortunately I'm on my Mac, so can't look at aeros.  How are things from your point of view?
[GMT 04/26/06 14:11:05] <ilana-GV> well co was low after the last cal...it actually was negative on aeros for a while...seems to be getting better with increasing number of cal runs
[GMT 04/26/06 14:11:17] <ilana-GV> cal iteself seems normal
[GMT 04/26/06 14:12:12] <TCampos-SeaOps> good to hear that the cal is normal.  sounds like the sensitivity may have been slow to rise up to normal levels.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:12:48] <ilana-GV> my guess as well...is that correctable later?
[GMT 04/26/06 14:13:09] <AlCooper-GV> JorgenJensen-JeffCo All is well. Approaching the Utah/Nevada border. Interesting sounding from initial climb, with unusually high tropospheric ozone and low tropopause. No instrumentation problems that I know of.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:13:22] LowellGenzlinger-ops (LowellGenz@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:14:30] <TCampos-SeaOps> ilana, absolutely fine.  all the final data include a time-dependent sensitivity function which is applied to the raw counts saved to the instrument's internal disk.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:15:11] BrianBillings-bishop (brian@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left &G5.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:15:29] <ilana-GV> okay then...so my monitor situation ndoesn't seem to be much better today.  one of them is okay so far, but I am worried about slight creep on the one attached to the beacon
[GMT 04/26/06 14:19:56] <TCampos-SeaOps> yeah the monitor situation is worrisome.  wonder why they haven't seen similar symptoms on the c-130?  unit age or something gv specific?
[GMT 04/26/06 14:21:35] <ilana-GV> well so far the creep is very small and is likely due to the 3-4 degree temp increase, but I just can't relax about it
[GMT 04/26/06 14:23:36] <ilana-GV> so again CO seems to be good right after a cal, then it sort of trails off towrads zero...is this normal
[GMT 04/26/06 14:23:43] <TCampos-SeaOps> hopefully you all will see some big waves, to help distract you...
[GMT 04/26/06 14:24:14] <ilana-GV> you mean make me nervous that monitors will respond to vibrations...I know I just think too much
[GMT 04/26/06 14:24:55] <TCampos-SeaOps> no, this sounds like the co sensitivity is changing too quickly.  i'll try to run upstairs to start aeros before heading to the c130 pre-flight.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:25:17] <ilana-GV> okay

[GMT 04/26/06 14:59:33] <Jcowan-Jeffco> It could be. I seem to remember that it slows things down a bit.  I have not been looking at the tracks much though.
[GMT 04/26/06 14:59:46] <rafchem-SeaOps> Ilana, we have aeros up now and have looked at the last couple of hours' data.  The sensitivity was changing quite a bit up to an hour ago (the first cal was x2 higher than typical).  Now things seem to have settled down quite nicely.  
[GMT 04/26/06 15:00:13] <rafchem-SeaOps> Ilana, so i guess we're off to the c-130 for awhile.  Have a nice wavy flight!

[GMT 04/26/06 15:02:34] <TCampos-SeaOps> yeah, the last two cals looked nearly identical, so things are fine and cancelling a cal is okay.  have fun...
[GMT 04/26/06 15:02:44] <rafchem-SeaOps> Hi Ilana, it's Cliff.  Teresa just ran up to her room.  As far as we can tell everything seems to be okay.  Go for it.

[GMT 04/26/06 18:19:32] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Where does the other side of the T go.  It should go to A0 something?
[GMT 04/26/06 18:22:31] <ads-GV> one side goes to Tcab1 the other goes to A/D .A0
[GMT 04/26/06 18:29:39] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay, that was what I needed.  Would you do me a favor, not the time and unplug the cable from A0 for 1 Min then plug it back in.  We want to test that analog card.

[GMT 04/26/06 18:43:11] <ads-GV> It's seem to calm down now.Do you want me to do the test ?
[GMT 04/26/06 18:44:03] <Jcowan-Jeffco> When you feel okay with it.  Like I said just at some point during the flight.  I will not be able to see the data here until tomorrow anyway.
