[GMT 04/27/06 15:05:35] <JamesDoyle-Ops> satellite imagery indicates a line of organized clouds in the lee of the Whites Mountains (on the west side).  This may be a line of cumulus.  No obvious wave activity to the south.
[GMT 04/27/06 15:11:26] <N2UW_> any indication of wave activity and wind profiler returns?

[GMT 04/27/06 16:00:14] <JamesDoyle-Ops> The clouds are clearing to the south, but this is happening rather slowly.  Not sure if the clearing line has made it to Independence yet.  I will call the MAPR trailer to find out.

[GMT 04/27/06 16:24:14] <N2UW> We are heading South to Independence.
[GMT 04/27/06 16:24:35] <JamesDoyle-Ops> We see you are heading south to Independence.  Correct?  Is the flight turbulent?

[GMT 04/27/06 16:41:21] <JamesDoyle-Ops> The ISS1 and ISS2 both show some rising motion, but this might be slope flow.  The winds look a bit weaker with 20-25kts at 2500 m (agl).  Hard to see clear evidence of waves.
[GMT 04/27/06 16:45:41] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Surface winds are mostly out of the north
[GMT 04/27/06 16:47:08] <JamesDoyle-Ops> The ISS1 surface station is reporting northerlies in the 10-14 m/s range.
