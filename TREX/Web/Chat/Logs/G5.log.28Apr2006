[GMT 04/28/06 19:59:19] <ads-GV> Any flight thie weekend <grin>.

[GMT 04/28/06 20:11:11] <ads-GV> My track plot in it's own window, set up as top with geo and landmarks keeps "walking" to the bottom right of the screen.  I cannot keep it centered.

[GMT 04/28/06 20:14:06] <JorgenJensen-GV> Hi Al, my impression was that we are talking marine SrCu. We can handle that with the dropsondes, I think, from 30 kft. The coastline photos may have to be changed if the clouds extend all the way to there.
[GMT 04/28/06 20:14:50] <JorgenJensen-GV> OK, will look out for them and maybe photo.
[GMT 04/28/06 20:14:52] <schanot_jeffco> I agree on dropsondes.  It was the low level photos that have us concerned
