[GMT 04/17/06 00:41:29] <AlCooper-GV> DaveR-home  Hi Dave, I restarted the RDME, hope I didn't cause a problem. It hung up with a message about an invalid device, and when I OK'd the message it just repeated endlessly. I didn't do anything with old files, just restarted. Seems to have worked OK since. I don't know how long it was hung up because I wasn't sitting at that seat when it stopped.
