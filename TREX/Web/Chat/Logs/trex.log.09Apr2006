[GMT 04/09/06 22:18:37] <JimMoore-Ops> Surface sites doen by IND have easterly and SE winds and light so far
[GMT 04/09/06 22:19:33] <JamesDoyle-ops> Ron:  As Jim said, the winds have increased here markedly in the last 15 mins - some dust devils nearby.  The direction is mostly southerly.

[GMT 04/09/06 22:40:09] <N2UW> Larry want the iss2 but i cannot get it on the catalog. Can you describe it?
[GMT 04/09/06 22:44:49] <heather_bishop> The flow below about 1500 m agl is SSE with speeds between 5 and 10 kts.  There is no data between about 1500 and 2500 m agl.   Above 2500 agl, the flow is from the SW at speeds between 25 and 30 kts.   Doppler vertical velocity suggests vertical velocities of about 2 m/s at crest level.  
[GMT 04/09/06 22:45:43] <N2UW> thanks
