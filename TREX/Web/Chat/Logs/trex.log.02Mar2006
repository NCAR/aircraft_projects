[GMT 03/02/06 21:05:03] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ChrisBurghart-Bishop are you getting D files from the GV ?  
[GMT 03/02/06 21:05:39] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Haven't seen any yet.  I looked in Boulder a while ago, and I'll check again now.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:06:36] <AlCooper-GV> Dick, dropsondes have looked good. Tracking was good (I guess because of this tight circle we're flying). Narrow window for launch meant almost all were in about the same location, just west of Independence.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:07:10] <AlCooper-GV> Laura, message received; we'll let you know when we start back. At least another hr here.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:08:09] <dickdirks-ops> Thanks Al.  We now see cap cloud and evidence of rotor here at Bishop.  Will you still be departing 2508 around 2200Z?
[GMT 03/02/06 21:08:32] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> ChrisWebster-Jeffco: we have a couple of files in Boulder, but it's weird.  The malbec LDM is set up to write them to ~ldm/data/gv_dropsonde_D, but

[GMT 03/02/06 21:17:16] <dickdirks-ops> Yes, either Fri or Sat is possible depending on work required after today's flight.  Looking at possible event on Sun-Mon.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:20:46] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ChrisBurghart_Bishop  _D has the D files, _d has the netCDF files....
[GMT 03/02/06 21:21:54] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> What's putting them there, though?  LDM isn't doing it via pqact (although it should be).
[GMT 03/02/06 21:22:26] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Actually, LDM should be writing the netCDF files to _netCDF and the D files to _D
[GMT 03/02/06 21:23:04] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ChrisBurghart-Bishop Thats what I was asking you, where are they from?  Yesterdays are probably from our ground test....
[GMT 03/02/06 21:23:31] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Got me...
[GMT 03/02/06 21:24:40] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Chris, I just plotted the files, and I think they are upsondes from the Independence site.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:27:35] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> ChrisWebster-Jeffco: have you done anything with LDM on malbec today?  Restarted, etc.?
[GMT 03/02/06 21:29:37] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Yes.  restarted twice for GV IP Addr changes.  Last one was at ~1:15

Both yesterday and now when I have tried to restart LDM on malbec, it goes into an infinite loop reporting "Waiting for the LDM to terminate".  It must always be restarted using either "ldmadmin restart" or "ldmadmin stop; ldmadmin start".
[GMT 03/02/06 21:32:23] <AlCooper-GV> Chris: Can you tell me how to get to the TREX data catalog from my (L1) computer? Can I do that?

[GMT 03/02/06 21:34:51] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> AlCooper-GV try http://gv/trex/catalog any luck with the google earth on Ron's machine?  How's it acting in general?
[GMT 03/02/06 21:45:19] <AlCooper-GV> ChrisWebster-Jeffco - I tried that, but it says the URL can't be retrieved. We gave up on Google Earth because we needed to look at other things during the flight. It would be good to get that to work for another flight.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:47:11] <AlCooper-GV> Ron's machine has been more stable lately. The problems might be associated with changes to the horizontal scales/axes; I think many of the crashes were when he was trying to change that. Maybe he can tell you more after the flight about what the problem was.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:49:24] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> AlCooper-GV how about http://hyper/trex/catalog ?  I know I viewed the catalog from a computer on the plane yesterday.  ok on ron's machine.
[GMT 03/02/06 21:55:43] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ChrisBurghart-Bishop On the gv ldm.log file I don't see the "send" for the D files that I'm seeing for the sql.  Are we sure the malbec entry is correct/accurate?  Do we need tabs. :)

[GMT 03/02/06 22:32:48] <AlCooper-GV> LauraPan - we've now left the primary research area and soon will be starting the ferry home. Any updates on trop height and preferred locations for the sounding?
[GMT 03/02/06 22:35:38] <LauraPan-FL0> AlCooper-GV, I am having trouble getting into my awips due to some dir restructure they are doing at comet. I will use other things to update you soon. My primary concern is the fuel situation. Incase we need to prioritize, my 1st preference is to make sure we have enough to do the ascent to 45K + (cont,)

[GMT 03/02/06 22:39:31] <AlCooper-GV> As near as I can tell, all instruments are working OK including O3 and CO. O3 made lots of sense during the transitions through the tropopause, and Cliff says CO has been stable as well.

[GMT 03/02/06 23:03:54] <LauraPan-FL0> AlCooper-GV,  It will be very interesting to see the wave signature across the tropopause in tracers. In addition, in the morning when you were approaching from NW, you were along the direction of a small intrusion.  You might be way above it though.
[GMT 03/02/06 23:05:25] <LauraPan-FL0> AlCooper-GV, the tropopause height on your way back around FourCorners is moderately high, between 36K-40K. Garth is fixing the awips right now. I will be more precise after that.
[GMT 03/02/06 23:06:17] <LauraPan-FL0> I would appreciate it very much if you watch skewT and clear pass the tropopause by at least 5Kft when doing the dip.

[GMT 03/02/06 23:07:57] <grubisic-laptop> It is hard to say weather there is evidence of rotor near Independence at the surface. Southerly flow in the central part of the valley, some easterly component on the alluvial fan, and in near ground wind profiler winds.

[GMT 03/02/06 23:14:16] <AlCooper-GV> Laura, OK, we'll watch the sounding, but I think the plan to descend will take us far below the tropopause, which was fairly high on the ferry out (nr 370) and appears to have remained about where it was.
[GMT 03/02/06 23:14:31] <grubisic-laptop> O.K. The rotor cloud visible in the satellite image (and outside) in the northern third of OV section south of Bishop.

[GMT 03/02/06 23:17:29] <LauraPan-FL0> AlCooper-GV, finally looked at the latest tropopause in vertical - it is pretty flat ~35K. A dip to 25K around Four Conners will be great. 
[GMT 03/02/06 23:18:16] <LauraPan-FL0> I have been watching your track on GoogleEarth the whole day.  What were the two repeating altitudes over the Owen Valley today?
[GMT 03/02/06 23:18:25] <AlCooper-GV> Laura, good, that's what is planned now and it looks as if it will work.
[GMT 03/02/06 23:21:36] <AlCooper-GV> Laura, the altitudes were 430, 370, and 320, repeated four times in racetrack patterns around the area, with climbs/descents between the racetracks.
