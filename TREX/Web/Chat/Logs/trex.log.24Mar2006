[GMT 03/24/06 22:48:57] <MarkBradford-Bishop> King Air reports "stationary waves, max 2 m/s"
[GMT 03/24/06 22:50:35] <ScotLoehrer-Bishop> 20 utc lemoore sounding: 2deg C inversion at 925mb; winds light and variable sfc to 800mb; winds at 700mb 250 at 18kt and at 650 mb 240 at 20 kt increasing to 30 kt at 580mb and 55kt at 300mb.
[GMT 03/24/06 22:51:59] <ScotLoehrer-Bishop> lemoore says 23utc sounding will be delayed ~1hr due to air traffic control

[GMT 03/24/06 22:53:22] <JamesDoyle-NRL> Thanks.  Some wave activity can be seen in the satellite imagery, mostly to the north.   The 2:30pm PST vis image shows a very thin wave cloud north of Independence and south of Bishop.  Might be part of a very short wavelength trapped wave.
