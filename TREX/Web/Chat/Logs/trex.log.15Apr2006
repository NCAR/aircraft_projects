[GMT 04/15/06 20:44:03] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---I certainly hope so. There are some thin wave clouds further to the north. Perhaps even further north beyond Bishop.

[GMT 04/15/06 21:21:35] <Vanda-HIAPER> Ops Center --- What was the reason for moving the KA departure forward in time? 
[GMT 04/15/06 21:24:04] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda - We moved it up to allow for better coordination with the GV and to give a little more light at the end of the flight.  We had no strong met. guidance to move it up.  There was some indication early that the westerlies were a little stronger than forecasted at 15z and 18z, but now I think the models are in line as far as I can tell.  The stronger flow may be just to the north in Mono county.  
[GMT 04/15/06 21:31:08] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Sam- Is the KA in the air?

[GMT 04/15/06 21:52:04] <martin-N2UW> we are at 2500ft, beginning the westbound leg
[GMT 04/15/06 21:53:39] <martin-N2UW> winds are around 20m/s, 235deg
[GMT 04/15/06 21:55:13] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> any waves ?
[GMT 04/15/06 21:57:28] <martin-N2UW> pretty quiet
[GMT 04/15/06 22:00:36] <martin-N2UW> now there is a small wave with w=1m/s
[GMT 04/15/06 22:03:51] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> REAL animation of last 30 minutes shows some indication of wave activity at about 3km agl - return signal is weak though
[GMT 04/15/06 22:11:45] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda- What are the wave amplitudes at 43kft?  
[GMT 04/15/06 22:16:22] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- the amplitude at 43 kft was 2.5 m/s peak to peak. The amplitude has increased at 30 kft. It was 3.9 m/s peak to peak on the S leg. So, we are seeing some intensification already. 
[GMT 04/15/06 22:18:05] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- On the first pass at 30 kft the amplitude was only 1 m/s peak to peak. There is also some choppiness at this 2nd pass at this altitude. 
[GMT 04/15/06 22:21:12] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim - Any change in the observed winds in the valley (wind profilers, soundings, etc.) and at the ridge top?

[GMT 04/15/06 22:27:25] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda:  The surface winds are still southeasterly in the valley.  The profilers show westerlies near crest level.  The vertical velocity at the profiler sites suggest some waves, but returns have decreased.  Spectral width still looks broad.  The 20UTC MAPR sounding shows pretty weak flow up to about 600mb.  The 20UTC Lemoore sounding has 25m/s at 450mb, 15-20 m/s at 650mb.  There is an inversion (subsidence) below 800mb, and a stable layer up to 5
