[GMT 04/10/06 00:53:26] <heather_bishop> Here's the latest on the winds.  Westerly and gusty here in Bishop.  ISS1 has westerly winds between 10 and 20 kts below about 500 agl.  The flow is from SE between 700 and 200 m agl.  About 5 kts in this layer.   Flow is from SSW above 2500 m agl with speeds of 15-20 kts.   Doppler velocites suggest there are strong vertical velocities near ridge top.
