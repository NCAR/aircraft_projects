[GMT 04/16/06 00:00:04] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Martin:  How is the ride?  Any turbulence?
[GMT 04/16/06 00:01:15] <martinw-N2UW> down at 8 and 11 kft it was prtty turbulent-enough for my taste, up to +/-7m/s
[GMT 04/16/06 00:05:01] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Profilers are showing fairly deep easterly flow in the valley.  Surface winds here in Bishop have a westerly component now.
[GMT 04/16/06 00:05:28] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda:  Is the south or north segment more active at 43kft?
[GMT 04/16/06 00:07:05] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- The north segment. We've seen the largest amplitude at 30 kft. 
[GMT 04/16/06 00:11:30] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- There seems to be at least one pass at 30 kft at the S leg that had wave amplitude larger than anything on the N leg.

[GMT 04/16/06 00:22:13] <JamesDoyle-Ops> One of the dropsondes (presumably in the valley) at 2304UTC shows southeasterly flow in the valley with a deep dry adiabatic layer to 610 mb.
[GMT 04/16/06 00:26:00] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- Is King Air on its way to Bishop? 
[GMT 04/16/06 00:26:18] <GregStossmeister-ops> Errol-G5, Is there any way you can give us drop locations - perhaps on the way home after you're done with all the drops?
[GMT 04/16/06 00:26:52] <GregStossmeister-ops> Vanda-They should have another hour on station.
[GMT 04/16/06 00:27:17] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Greg, we've been getting the drop datafiles, if that would be sufficient
[GMT 04/16/06 00:27:18] <martinw-N2UW> we are now at 17kft and saw a nice wave with amp of +/-5 m/s
[GMT 04/16/06 00:28:01] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, can you e-mail me locations from the datafiles?
[GMT 04/16/06 00:28:17] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Do you want initial or final locations?
[GMT 04/16/06 00:28:55] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, Final would be fine.
[GMT 04/16/06 00:29:13] <Errol-G5> I followed all thaat

[GMT 04/16/06 00:29:34] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Perfect -- there's a script that will yank out the final locations from the datafiles.  Once the G5 is done littering :), I'll run the script and send you the result.

[GMT 04/16/06 00:31:24] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I take back the "littering" comment -- the different-colored parachutes are actually quite decorative
[GMT 04/16/06 00:32:07] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Any fast falls on this flight, out of curiosity?
[GMT 04/16/06 00:32:57] <Errol-G5> in the future we are going to try to WRAP the Owens Valley in Parachute Material
[GMT 04/16/06 00:33:17] <Errol-G5> A couple but not for the usual reasons I think
[GMT 04/16/06 00:33:23] <MarkBradford-Boulder> heh

[GMT 04/16/06 00:36:11] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda:  Can you confirm that you've received the message that the King Air is due to leave the area at approx. 0130 UTC.

[GMT 04/16/06 01:06:52] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- The amplitude is only +2.5, -1.5 m/s. The nice thing is their coherent structure and 6-7 wave crests downwind of the Sierra.

[GMT 04/16/06 18:01:41] <N2UW> fine. was a litte bumpy at the box in 11000, now its quite smooth
[GMT 04/16/06 18:03:23] <N2UW> a lot of aeosols are coming up from the owes lake now
[GMT 04/16/06 18:05:02] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> the lidars are happy about that
[GMT 04/16/06 18:06:18] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> looking at the actual lidar measurements a wcr-lidar pattern should be considered for the afternoon flight
[GMT 04/16/06 18:10:18] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> I just went outside and the approaching Owens lake dust is very obvious from the REAL site now
[GMT 04/16/06 18:11:59] <GregStossmeister-ops> N2UW, FYI - We just had a report of strong westerlies breaking into the valley 4 miles south of big pine.
[GMT 04/16/06 18:27:05] <JamesDoyle-Ops> What altitude are you at now?
[GMT 04/16/06 18:27:33] <N2UW> we just reached 25000ft
[GMT 04/16/06 18:29:59] <JamesDoyle-Ops> The ISS2 surface data is showing weak and variable winds with some westerlies
[GMT 04/16/06 18:31:38] <N2UW> we have about 68kt from 240
[GMT 04/16/06 18:35:49] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> winds are weak and easterly at the REAL site

[GMT 04/16/06 18:41:31] <N2UW> according to vert. velocity we had 2 nice waves over the valley. distance between crests about 3 minutes (dont't know what's our flight speed)

[GMT 04/16/06 20:30:16] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda:  The King Air found fairly small amplitude waves 2-3 m/s at 25 kft.  No evidence of rotors.  The most turbulent level was 11kft with some strong vertical velocity signals at the corner of the box.
[GMT 04/16/06 20:31:48] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- I notice fairly strong easterly winds between 750 and 1,000 m AGL in the wind profiler returns starting at 18:00 UTC. What is your interpretation of those? I see them in ISS2 and MAPR wind profiles. 
[GMT 04/16/06 20:38:14] <JamesDoyle-Ops> I noticed those too.  I'm actually not sure.  The pressure gradient is doing some strange things here in Bishop.  We started out with southerlies this morning.  We had some moderate westerlies and then back to Southerlies.  
[GMT 04/16/06 20:38:54] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Ron Smith reported that dust is streaming off of Owens Lake and moving northward. The Alabama Hills were obscured for the latter part of the flight.
[GMT 04/16/06 20:40:13] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim -- Good for lidars. Now, we only need a rotor cloud to take some good dual-Doppler lidar and radar data. 
[GMT 04/16/06 20:40:25] <JamesDoyle-Ops> There were some strong westerlies reported by Alex and Dave W. just south of Big Pine with blowing dust.

[GMT 04/16/06 21:09:54] <Vanda-HIAPER> Laura --- the waves are stronger, really nice waves over the Great Basin. The amplitudes are much larger than yesterday. 
[GMT 04/16/06 21:12:33] <LauraPan-home> great.
[GMT 04/16/06 21:15:06] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda: The 12Z COAMPS is now showing very strong waves through about 12Z tomorrow consistent with WRF and other models.  There is a rotor signature beginning around 23Z.

[GMT 04/16/06 22:28:36] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Vanda:  That's quite large.  Buckle up at 43kft, they might be breaking.  King Air showed a nice wave at 23kft over the Inyos.

[GMT 04/16/06 22:52:42] <GregStossmeister-ops> areinecke-uw, How does Ron feel anbout the GV dropping sonde on their northern track while you guys are over owens lake?
[GMT 04/16/06 22:54:30] <GregStossmeister-ops> vanda-did you understand the request to stop dropsondes?
[GMT 04/16/06 22:54:56] <areinecke-uw> greg: vanda: we will be back on track in ~30 min so drop sondes are alright on the northern track
[GMT 04/16/06 22:55:34] <Vanda-HIAPER> I am reading through your messages. We just 4 on the S leg. 
[GMT 04/16/06 22:55:45] <Vanda-HIAPER> How far south of its Independence section is King Air? 
[GMT 04/16/06 22:56:33] <areinecke-uw> vanda we are over owens lake ~20 miles
[GMT 04/16/06 22:57:14] <areinecke-uw> 20 miles south of IND

[GMT 04/16/06 22:58:27] <Vanda-HIAPER> King Air - I received that. 
[GMT 04/16/06 22:59:27] <Vanda-HIAPER> King Air -- Our first dropsonde is at 650 mbars over the S leg. 
[GMT 04/16/06 22:59:34] <GregStossmeister-ops> areinecke-uw, please confirm you will stay down near owens lake for next 30 min so GV can drop sondes on northern track if desired
[GMT 04/16/06 22:59:47] <Vanda-HIAPER> King Air --- communicate changes in your tracks in advance! 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:02:20] <Vanda-HIAPER> KingAir --- What is your intent for the rest of the mission? 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:02:27] areinecke-uw (UW@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Ping timeout
[GMT 04/16/06 23:04:27] <GregStossmeister-ops> Vanda - suggest you work out immediate coordination pilot-to-pilot we aren't sure either what the KA plans for the rest of their flight - deviation was unexpected.

[GMT 04/16/06 23:05:36] <Vanda-HIAPER> GregS --- I just did. Bob is coveying my message to King Air. My suggestion is for them to work over Owens Valley. We are will not drop sondes on the N leg over Independence from FL430. 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:05:48] <Vanda-HIAPER> GregS --- I meant to say over owens lake! 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:06:50] <GregStossmeister-ops> Vanda-ok thanks - I was just trying to keep your options open.
[GMT 04/16/06 23:07:29] <Vanda-HIAPER> GregS --- I just heard back from KA. They are going back to Independence section. We will resume dropping sondes on our S leg. 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:08:07] <GregStossmeister-ops> Vanda-ok thanks. 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:08:53] <GregStossmeister-ops> Vanda-by the way did you have any interesting measurements on your 43k ft racetrack?
[GMT 04/16/06 23:11:05] <Vanda-HIAPER> GregS -- S leg was quite tame only 6-7 m/s peak to peak, N leg slightly more energetic ~12.5 m/s 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:11:24] <GSPoulos-Independence> Independence is now starting to gust from the west and the Central tower is now turning westerlies. Southerlies persist at west alluvial slope tower (potential horizontal eddy).

[GMT 04/16/06 23:13:54] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim --- No turbulence at 43 kft. Going down to 30 kft. 
[GMT 04/16/06 23:16:17] <GregStossmeister-ops> areinecke-uw, are you planning to stick with previous patterns around independence?
