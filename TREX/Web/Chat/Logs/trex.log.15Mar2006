[GMT 03/15/06 00:41:09] <LauraPan-FL0> ron, sorry I had a budget meeting with Rit that went longer than expected but I am back.

[GMT 03/15/06 00:41:34] <JimDoyle-GV> We currently in the middle of our FL430 race track.  Some interesting waves with amplitudes of +/- 5m/s and large perturbations in the velocities
[GMT 03/15/06 00:42:46] <LauraPan-FL0> The point of going lower is not to get well mixed troposphere but the potential signature of intruding stratospheric air along the upper level front.
[GMT 03/15/06 00:44:07] <LauraPan-FL0> based on forecast, it may reach your region at ~ 20Kft level. You should see packed isentropes ~ 300K theta if reaching that.
[GMT 03/15/06 00:44:56] <RonSmith_GV> laura:  We are back u in the stratosphere again at 43kft, doing a racetrack. Our time is running out. Do you have advice for the ferry sounding on the way home?
[GMT 03/15/06 00:49:05] <LauraPan-FL0> If that is the case, my suggestion is to do the sounding as early as possible down wind and as deep as possible to see if we catch any interesting ozone enhancement. 
[GMT 03/15/06 00:51:32] <LauraPan-FL0> the forecast show a chunck of stratospheric air around 400 km in horizontal dimension and centered over Owen Valley
[GMT 03/15/06 00:52:42] <LauraPan-FL0> vertically, it is centered around 5 km altitude with the upper edge around 18Kft.
[GMT 03/15/06 00:53:28] <LauraPan-FL0> I understand it may be too low to catch but with this kind of structure, the downwind deep profile should be good to have

[GMT 03/15/06 01:08:05] <LauraPan-FL0> again, you may not have missed it because it is only coming.  A deep sounding on the way back should be good. If the tropopause when you transect is above 30Kft, you would be ahead of the intrusion  and my not get much signal.
