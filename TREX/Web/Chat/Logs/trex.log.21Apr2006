[GMT 04/21/06 14:20:30] <AlCooper-G5> Mostly smooth, with waves, at FL400. We have skimmed the tropopause as we passed over Utah, and are now in stratosphere over Nevada. Ci below obscures the ground.

[GMT 04/21/06 14:28:45] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-GV, looks like WCN is still working okay, even after 1hr-10min at 40kft. That's better than before, when it gave up after ~50 min.

[GMT 04/21/06 16:57:56] <LauraPan-FL0> AlCooper-G5, I looked on map and track C seems more south than before. If you get back to CO from Four Corners, the region is iin a ridge tropopause ~ 200-175 mb (~ 40Kft). Profiling there is less interesting (for the reason of hard to get a complete tracer space coverge)  but nevertheless good to have. An alternative I propose is to come all the way back and do a sounding at the Northen side of jeffco, roughly border of CO-WY-NE. 
[GMT 04/21/06 16:57:56] <LauraPan-FL0>  The tropopause there is much lower, 30-35 Kft. Assuming at 450, go up to 470, descent to 200, approach landing from the north side. Let me know if the alt sounds reasonable. I will look up more met field details for that.
[GMT 04/21/06 16:59:13] <JimM-G5> GregStossmeister-ops, Light chop at 370 over owens val.  VV maybe at +1.5 m/s tops

[GMT 04/21/06 17:01:56] <AlCooper-G5> LauraPan-FL0 Thanks for the information. I'll think about that and talk to pilots. 
[GMT 04/21/06 17:02:58] <dirks2_> N2UW, Ask Jim if he wants to cancel 02Z soundings.
[GMT 04/21/06 17:03:55] <N2UW> Stossmeister-ops, completed 16, 12, and 8 boxes two each, thus far no highly organized waves
[GMT 04/21/06 17:05:23] <N2UW> dirks2_, confirm cancellation of 02Z soundings

[GMT 04/21/06 17:24:18] <AlCooper-G5> GregStossmeister-ops We are nearing the end of our 5th racetrack, and are finding only very weak waves and isolated regions of weak turbulence, mostly outside of Owens Valley. I propose to complete the 6th racetrack at FL300, then see if we can climb in the area for a good sounding while we exit to the north, returning to Colorado. Sound right?
[GMT 04/21/06 17:26:38] <dirks2_> N2UW--does Jim have any problems with early return proposed by GV?
[GMT 04/21/06 17:28:34] <N2UW_> dirks2_, early return sounds good

We're reluctant to try a deep descent off-track now. We'll hold high as long as comfortable before starting the descent.

[GMT 04/21/06 18:52:59] <Laura-FL0> I was gone looking at next weeks forecast, copy that you  do not want to go north of Denver for sounding.  did I miss anything else?
[GMT 04/21/06 18:54:10] <AlCooper-G5> LauraPan-FL0 I'll check, but I suspect that's difficult because we were fueled for a 9 hr mission and so are still a little heavy. 
[GMT 04/21/06 18:56:44] <AlCooper-G5> Data from the TREX area should be interesting today. Tropopause was low (36-37K) so we were well into the stratosphere. Again, we saw the peak in O3 at 40-41K that we've seen many times before, with surprisingly low values above. We did have higher O3 on the ferry out, reaching 500 as we went from trop. to strat. at FL400. 
[GMT 04/21/06 18:57:21] <Laura-FL0> the point of sounding is to cover both UT and LS if possible. We have not had many of those in a complete stack.  Please see what you can do with the understanding that is the desire.  The past a few flights the situation has been that we sampled LS in Utah and UT in CO. Copy that you may be too heavy. It is not critical today to do anything difficult. We may have good chance mid next week. Forecast is really interesting to me. 
[GMT 04/21/06 18:57:21] <AlCooper-G5> LauraPan-FL0 Bob confirms that we can't go higher; we are just able to maintain 450 at this weight.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:58:20] <Laura-FL0> okay
[GMT 04/21/06 18:59:04] <Laura-FL0> off to 1pm meeting but will try to stay connected when moving.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:59:52] <AlCooper-G5> LauraPan-FL0 OK, thanks; better to look ahead to a good case and save hrs now for it, I think.
