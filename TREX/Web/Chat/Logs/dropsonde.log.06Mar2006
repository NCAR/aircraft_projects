[GMT 03/06/06 00:02:12] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol?
[GMT 03/06/06 00:07:34] <errol-GV> more sondes are on the way in about 3 minutes
[GMT 03/06/06 00:08:40] <GSPoulos-Independence> 10-4. Can you drop 0.02 longitude more (west, that is) than last time for sonde #2?
[GMT 03/06/06 00:20:32] <errol-GV> the 4 are out , how did the lidar test go?
[GMT 03/06/06 00:21:21] <GSPoulos-Independence> I need to know when #2 is at 6500 m!!
[GMT 03/06/06 00:21:40] <GSPoulos-Independence> Then I'll ask the lidar to 'look up'.
[GMT 03/06/06 00:27:07] <GSPoulos-Independence> OK, by my calculations #2 would be at 6500 m about 1 minute ago. The lidar will be looking up taking vertical velocity for 10 minutes starting at 0036UTC. Please confirm the landing points when they are down if possible. It would be great to have the launch points too.
[GMT 03/06/06 00:38:42] <errol-GV> next batch of groound points
[GMT 03/06/06 00:38:46] <errol-GV> -118.184075  36.776075  1253.61
[GMT 03/06/06 00:38:49] <errol-GV> -118.079459  36.889773  1878.61
[GMT 03/06/06 00:38:49] <errol-GV> -118.004132  36.985775  2494.05
[GMT 03/06/06 00:38:49] <errol-GV> -117.887421  37.123618  1623.25 
[GMT 03/06/06 00:41:56] <GSPoulos-Independence> Bombardier Korn you are a genius! #1 appears to be 0.024 degrees latitude south of the site. That would be 2.1km!
[GMT 03/06/06 00:43:13] <GSPoulos-Independence> Whereever you dropped that #1 from - do it there again or at least one of them - the pilot might be a bit more south of the last track or you would've smacked 'em on the nose.
[GMT 03/06/06 00:52:13] <errol-GV> Al said to move the site
[GMT 03/06/06 00:55:18] <GSPoulos-Independence> I'll talk to Calhoun and see what I can do! I just spoke with the lidar and they captured the vertical velocity profile for the entire last 2.5 - 3.0 km agl of the drop of #1. If you drop about 0.01 degree latitude further north than the #1 launch point of the last run I think we'll have it drift right over!
[GMT 03/06/06 01:01:29] <GSPoulos-Independence> How many more drop sets are you planning to do? 
[GMT 03/06/06 01:08:26] <GSPoulos-Independence> Bombardier?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:08:50] <GSPoulos-Independence> Drop time coming?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:09:10] <errol-GV> we are doing one or two more
[GMT 03/06/06 01:09:22] <errol-GV> drops are coming up in 5 minutes or so
[GMT 03/06/06 01:10:13] <GSPoulos-Independence> OK, drop one 0.01 degree further north than your last #1.
[GMT 03/06/06 01:11:29] <errol-GV> we are running a drop location futures betting market
[GMT 03/06/06 01:12:28] <GSPoulos-Independence> I'll put $10 down you get within 0.5km before the flight is over, Mr. Wall Street.
[GMT 03/06/06 01:25:30] <errol-GV> 4 more are on the way
[GMT 03/06/06 01:26:35] <errol-GV> all staacks are done - one more drop on way out
[GMT 03/06/06 01:27:11] <errol-GV> correction - we finish this stack and then one more drop on way out
[GMT 03/06/06 01:27:38] <GSPoulos-Independence> So is there another set of 4 coming? What altitude is #1 at now?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:29:33] <errol-GV> -118.232 36.716
[GMT 03/06/06 01:30:01] <errol-GV> took a break to do some leg lifts 
[GMT 03/06/06 01:32:22] <GSPoulos-Independence> Altitude of #1?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:32:46] <GSPoulos-Independence> Another set of 4 coming?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:37:34] <errol-GV> no - just one more in aboout half hour
[GMT 03/06/06 01:38:13] <GSPoulos-Independence> Are they all down?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:53:08] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:53:25] <GSPoulos-Independence> Landing points?
[GMT 03/06/06 01:57:17] <errol-GV> I already sent them but here they are again
[GMT 03/06/06 01:57:43] <errol-GV> -118.220654  36.725571  1568.56

[GMT 03/06/06 01:57:45] <errol-GV> -117.933728  37.064852  2115.00
[GMT 03/06/06 01:58:57] <errol-GV> maybe I did not send them
[GMT 03/06/06 01:59:33] <GSPoulos-Independence> What time did #1 hit?

[GMT 03/06/06 02:05:44] <GSPoulos-Independence> Errol, many thanks. We'll do a few more tomorrow. Should be easier to target in with this practice. We got two good ones.
[GMT 03/06/06 02:08:22] <errol-GV> you helped me make $10000.38 on sonde placement bets
