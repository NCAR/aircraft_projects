[GMT 04/02/06 15:28:08] <AlCooper-GV> JimMoore-Ops Thanks. All looks good for instruments here. Tropopause at about FL370 where we climbed through (near Utah border)
[GMT 04/02/06 15:49:53] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: we're still about an hour away from the area. (We had a short delay before takeoff.) Are the other aircraft working in the area now? (I was unsure if their takeoff times remained as planned yesterday?)
[GMT 04/02/06 15:51:55] <JimMoore-Ops> AlCooper-GV, Indeed the K/A is aloft because we see their tracks and assume the BAe took off at around 0830A.

[GMT 04/02/06 17:39:54] <AlCooper-GV> JimMoore-Ops Thanks, we heard them departing. Will be interested to learn if they think the mission was good. So far, this is pretty dull here. 4 sondes released from FL430 on the S leg. Now turning back for the N leg.
[GMT 04/02/06 17:48:58] <GSPoulos-GV> 3 sondes were dropped at ~ 8.75km spacing and the other at the western edge.

[GMT 04/02/06 18:22:37] <JimMoore-Ops> AlCooper-GV, K/A reported max vert vel at 3 m/s.  Complicated flow in the valley and valley flow decoupled from flow above the crest.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:24:55] <AlCooper-GV> JimMoore-Ops Thanks, Jim.  We're now at FL300 and starting our racetrack at that altitude. We won't be dropping sondes on this racetrack. There's a little turbulence in the region we pass through as we turn at the NE corner of this racetrack, beyond the waves and not apparently associated with them, but perhaps enough to be considered "light chop".
[GMT 04/02/06 18:27:56] <JimMoore-Ops> Latest sounding from upwind suggests a bit weaker flow at ridge top

[GMT 04/02/06 18:44:52] <JamesDoyle-Ops> I'm back from the King Air flight.  We found relatively small amplitude waves.  At 15kft we saw a max w~3 m/s and by 22kft max w~1.5 or 2 m/s.  Lots of complex inversions in the valley with a few cu topped by lenticular clouds.  SEerly winds in the valley beginning to pick up.  KA is scheduled to fly again to take another look at the waves, mostly above crest height.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:45:11] <SteveWilliams-ops> Al Cooper: Anything to report on this leg so far?
[GMT 04/02/06 18:45:37] <AlCooper-GV> JimMoore-Ops The thin cirrus was no problem for us at FL300, and we have completed that racetrack. Climbing now back to FL430. We didn't see much for wave motion on that pass. Again, there is a little turbulence at the NE corner where we turn.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:45:38] <JamesDoyle-Ops> I should add that we did see some evidence of trapped waves (over a couple of wave crests) with a wavelength of about 13.5 km.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:47:28] <SteveWilliams-ops> Al Cooper: Thanks. Jim Moore has left to fly on the King Air on their second flight this afternoon, so Jim Doyle and I will be monitoring chat
[GMT 04/02/06 18:50:07] <AlCooper-GV> JamesDoyle-Ops Thanks for that report. It has been pretty dull in the GV, I'm afraid. There are waves just NE of Independence and at the corresponding location on the S leg, but with amplitude of only about 1 m/s. We saw a more chaotic wave structure at FL300, and some more turbulence there, but otherwise not much amplitude change with altitude. Cirrus is thin and has not been a problem for us.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:55:07] <GSPoulos-GV> Any information from MGAUS soundings that correspond to potentially improving conditions?
[GMT 04/02/06 18:57:29] <SteveWilliams-ops> GSPoulos-GV, The 17Z release did not plot in the catalog. We'll take a look at the data and get back to you....
[GMT 04/02/06 18:57:45] <JamesDoyle-Ops> AlCooper-GV:  Thanks for the update.  The KA flight was pretty smooth with the exception of light chop between inversions.  The waves aren't penetrating the valley much at all.  Its almost like a decoupled flow.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:59:32] <JamesDoyle-Ops> GSPoulos-GV, Sounding:  10m/s@263 at 700mb, 15m/s@247 at 650mb, 20m/s@212 at 500 mb, and 41 m/s@222 at 300mb.

[GMT 04/02/06 19:08:44] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: Again at FL430 now, in racetrack #5. A nice smooth wave series on the S leg, still very modest amplitude (1 m/s), I think located a little more W than on previous racetracks. Cirrus in the SW corner seems to be thickening at lower level. Tropopause is high, near FL400. Four more sondes released on this leg.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:25:00] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: Nice looking series of waves encountered over and NE of Independence, still with amplitude of 1-1.5 m/s, with wavelength decreasing downwind. Planning descent to FL380, and more sondes there. BAe has left the area, and we haven't heard from the KA yet, so there may be a short opportunity to drop on the northern lev. We'll monitor for the KA, because I know they are planning another flight.

Lower cloud layer is thickening; we'll try to do FL330 next, but may have to adjust around the cloud layer. We have heard the KA approaching the area, soon after the BAe-146 left, so we won't drop on the N leg.

[GMT 04/02/06 20:16:21] <N2UW_> track eastward wave -2.9 +1.5 over the Sierra crest at FL190
[GMT 04/02/06 20:17:27] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: GV is now climbing back to FL430 in preparation for racetrack #8, and will release sondes again on the southern leg of the racetrack. We didn't see much for waves at FL330, but there was a little turbulence and an interesting larger updraft/weak-updraft-or-downdraft region over Independence. There's some uncertainty up-vs-down at these small amplitudes, but the down region did have significantly higher pot. temperature. 
[GMT 04/02/06 20:18:21] <AlCooper-GV> (We potentially have about 1.5 h left in the area.)

Clouds are thicker below us, and I'm not sure we'll be able to get lower again, but I'll try after this racetrack. Still not seeing waves above 1.5 m/s amplitude, but they tend to be in the same places. An interesting ozone structure on the last climb, with high ozone around the tropopause but then O3 decreasing sharply above

[GMT 04/02/06 21:07:27] <JamesDoyle-Ops> AlCooper-GV:  On the previous two flights (maybe more), I remember seeing an ozone max near the tropopause or in the lower statosphere too.  I don't know if the structure in the ozone you are seeing today is similar.
[GMT 04/02/06 21:09:47] <AlCooper-GV> JamesDoyle-Ops Jim, yes, it's similar to what I saw on RF05 but even more pronounced. The consistency with which this feature appears is very interesting, I think.
[GMT 04/02/06 21:12:06] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: We have completed racetrack #9, and are descending to FL380 for another pair of racetracks there. Then we'll be out of time. Good consistency between those two FL430 racetracks, each with waves of similar character at the same place.

[GMT 04/02/06 21:36:10] <GSPoulos-GV> Steve - We have completed 29 drops and will do another 4 for a total of 33 (preliminary count). There have been 2 fast falls and perhaps two with 'data problems'.

[GMT 04/02/06 21:40:24] <GSPoulos-GV> We've not been analyzing the drops all along due to an onboard data/file transmission issue, presuming you are referring to the atmospheric variables and not the drop locations/landing spots.
[GMT 04/02/06 21:43:49] <SteveWilliams-ops> GSPoulos-GV, yes I meant the atmospheric variables... we'll worry about the landing spots later.

[GMT 04/02/06 21:46:03] <MarkBradford-Bishop> GSPoulos-GV: Is it safe to assume that the sonde files aren't getting sent down due to the same onboard issue?

[GMT 04/02/06 21:52:52] <GSPoulos-GV>   Errol just told me that, yes, he believes it derives from the same issue as he has had copying files onboard. He attempted a transfer after 'Chris cleared out 3 Inodes' (paraphrasing Teresa) and was unsuccessful.

[GMT 04/02/06 22:23:23] <AlCooper-GV> JamesDoyle-Ops Thanks, Jim, I saw that. The reports over Colorado when we started this flight were really dense, and there was a SIGMET for turbulence there, but our departure wasn't too bad.
