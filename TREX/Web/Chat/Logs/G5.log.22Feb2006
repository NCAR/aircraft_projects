[GMT 02/22/06 20:31:45] <DaveR-G5> Jorgen- we just started first L pattern. No squawks on instrumentation yet. The few analog signals that I've looked at seem smooth (no spikes, no jumps).
[GMT 02/22/06 20:33:14] <jbj> I understand that there were problems earlier today with the LWC sensor, and that it isn't installed (the element, that is).
[GMT 02/22/06 20:33:34] <jbj> Thus no need to fly through cloud.
[GMT 02/22/06 20:33:37] <DaveR-G5> WCN has been working okay unitl last ~5 min at this altitude 45kft. It's now complaining that flow is out of spec (320 instead of required 300+/-5).
[GMT 02/22/06 20:34:56] <DaveR-G5> What I heard from JohnC was that the King element burned up during ground tests. Instantly. Should have a few seconds before it gets too hot. Unit is being returned to PMI for check.
[GMT 02/22/06 20:35:16] <jbj> Yes.
[GMT 02/22/06 20:35:52] <DaveR-G5> aeros 3316 (WinXP) seems to be working well. No hiccups, log scale functional, and I can save configuration file.

[GMT 02/22/06 20:45:04] <DaveR-G5> Track plot on aeros 3316 (WinxP) working well - geopol boundaries, lakes, rivers, etc.  However, the wind directions look wonkers. Wind at 45kft is 270/38 m/s but barbs on track plot show ~360/70kt. So maybe speed is okay but direction sucks.
[GMT 02/22/06 20:50:59] <DaveR-G5> That is -- the way that wind barb is displayed looks wrong on track plot.
[GMT 02/22/06 20:56:51] <AlCooper-FL1> For the record (and without knowing what should be working), here's what I see:
[GMT 02/22/06 20:57:07] <AlCooper-FL1> 1. Google earth and Google map tracks look good
[GMT 02/22/06 20:57:52] <AlCooper-FL1> 2. Parameters in Google maps look bad. GGALT stays around 1735 m, most others don't display
[GMT 02/22/06 20:58:55] <AlCooper-FL1> 3. Have problems with aeros (version 3316): also bad for most variables, and map display hangs up.
[GMT 02/22/06 20:59:15] <AlCooper-FL1> (tia)
[GMT 02/22/06 21:01:26] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> 4. tke/acvar not working.
[GMT 02/22/06 21:05:51] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Re: 2.: fixed for the moment, was set for C130.
[GMT 02/22/06 21:08:56] <AlCooper-FL1> CW: Yes, what I see looks right now (for altitude)

[GMT 02/22/06 21:25:35] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- Ilana says yes. It's with papers next to keyboard in the office she shares with CliffH. She asks that you photocopy it if you need to take a copy.
[GMT 02/22/06 21:28:01] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Thanks, Dave and Ilana.  I'll make a copy for Roger ASAP.
[GMT 02/22/06 21:34:31] <DaveR-G5> aeros 3316 (Winxp) is cpu hog. I have about 3 windows, and it's using 50% of cpu (pentium-4, 1Gb ram). Have to wait for mouse-click responses. Upon closing track window, cpu drops to ~15% and response is much better.
[GMT 02/22/06 21:35:49] <DaveR-G5> Total Temps are tracking parallel, ~5C separation. No jumps, no spikes.

[GMT 02/22/06 21:55:12] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Are you heading back now.
[GMT 02/22/06 21:57:50] <DaveR-G5> JohnC- no. We finished speed run at 10kft and will do boundary layer leg enroute. 
[GMT 02/22/06 21:59:43] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Okay just looking for an ETA when you get one.
[GMT 02/22/06 22:01:16] <ads-G5> john,DP came back to life after we go down at 10,000 feets,seem they didn't funtion well at 44,000 f
[GMT 02/22/06 22:03:37] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Ta, that is pretty normal.  They seem not to workwhen the dew point is below -70C or so.
[GMT 02/22/06 22:03:40] <DaveR-G5> JohnC et al.- we're on our way back. ETA ~3:30p
