[GMT 03/21/06 00:14:22] <BrianBillings-REAL> What is the status of the King Air flight? Did they have to abandon because of IFR conditions.
[GMT 03/21/06 00:14:44] <MarkBradford-Bishop> No, they decided it was boring and came home early
[GMT 03/21/06 00:14:55] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Landed at 16:17 local
[GMT 03/21/06 00:15:49] <BrianBillings-REAL> I've set up X-chat at the REAL site, so they'll be able to provide real-time scans for future IOP's.
[GMT 03/21/06 00:16:06] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Excellent
