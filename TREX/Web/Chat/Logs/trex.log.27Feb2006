[GMT 02/27/06 16:58:14] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Morning, Mike
[GMT 02/27/06 16:59:05] <MikeDaniels-unesco> Hi Mark, how goes it?
[GMT 02/27/06 16:59:33] <MarkBradford-Bishop> So far so good -- ops center is quiet this morning, but the first daily planning meeting is in a few hours, so things should pick up
[GMT 02/27/06 17:02:22] <MikeDaniels-unesco> Sounds good.  Do you know if the G-V in the air now?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:02:56] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I haven't heard anything about that.  I've heard that the King Air is supposed to arrive today, but we don't know what time.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:05:01] <MikeDaniels-unesco> btw, I've got a real tentative connection here via a weak GSM cellphone signal and GPRS
[GMT 02/27/06 17:05:26] <MikeDaniels-unesco> their wifi only allows web connectivity :-(
[GMT 02/27/06 17:06:07] <MikeDaniels-unesco> so if i drop out unexpectedly that is why
[GMT 02/27/06 17:07:29] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I ran into that in the Anchorage airport last month.  Better web than nothing, but it was surprisingly restrictive.  How's the meeting on your end?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:08:33] <RonRuth-BJC> Anyone know who will be operating the TREX Access Grid out there?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:08:55] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Mostly Brandon, Ron, with me lending a hand
[GMT 02/27/06 17:09:29] <RonRuth-BJC> Do you have any time to fire it up and see whether we can get it working before it's needed?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:09:32] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Then Jody, when she replaces Brandon, and finally Joe when he replaces Jody
[GMT 02/27/06 17:09:42] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Absolutely, Ron, are you ready to do that now?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:11:29] <MikeDaniels-unesco> gtg, bye
[GMT 02/27/06 17:11:36] MikeDaniels-unesco (daniels@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 02/27/06 17:11:44] <RonRuth-BJC> Soon, perhaps.  There is an impromptu gathering in our conference room right now.  I can check to see how long they will be and get back to you.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:12:33] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Okay
[GMT 02/27/06 17:12:46] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Brandon was planning to do a test with DRI around 10 our time, so 11 your time
[GMT 02/27/06 17:13:06] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> I am working on a test with DRI around 10 am Pacific.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:13:36] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> I will also see if Jay can set up the FL link at the same time.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:13:53] <RonRuth-BJC> That should work.  Do you know the particulars, like which virtual room we are joining and any other access information I'll need to connect?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:14:01] <RonRuth-BJC> I can contact Jay, too, if that's easier.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:14:39] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> If you can.  I am working with DRI I think we will be using their Venue, don't know which room yet.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:15:11] <RonRuth-BJC> OK.  I'll try to get things set up with Jay.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:15:13] <MarkBradford-Bishop> We have our Access Grid box turned on, so we can test any time.

[GMT 02/27/06 17:26:14] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Ahoy the Access Grid!
[GMT 02/27/06 17:26:24] <AG-Bishop> Greetings
[GMT 02/27/06 17:26:25] <RonRuth-BJC> Our conference room should be free by 10AM PST.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:26:52] <AG-Bishop> K, We just installed a chat client on the AG machine.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:27:03] <MarkBradford-Bishop> That's Brandon driving.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:28:31] <AG-Bishop> Ron, I sent you the venue and room info, did you get it?
[GMT 02/27/06 17:47:07] <RonRuth-BJC> Got it.  I'll pass it along to Jay.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:48:14] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> I am trying to find out the login information.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:55:30] <AG-Bishop> OK,  I have the password info, I will send it to you by email.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:57:02] <RonRuth-BJC> I need login/password info, too.
[GMT 02/27/06 17:57:21] <AG-Bishop> Just emailed it to you and Jay
[GMT 02/27/06 18:13:47] <AG-Bishop> Hi
