[GMT 04/06/06 17:15:52] <ilana-GV> that was our assessment too.  I didn't turn on the NO til we were about 20 kft today due to turbulence so the first part of graph is just going to be zero until ~16:56

[GMT 04/06/06 18:33:08] <DaveR-Jeffco> G5 crew- I see WCN is not working yet. If it is thirsty, you can give it some water via button on its front panel. Push right-most button (drain/prime), push it once more to select PRIME, then hold it in for 1+ sec. It will inject 20 squirts of water. Careful to avoid closing RDMA laptop display, else it will hibernate.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:36:31] <JorgenJensen-GV> Nice view of the KA
[GMT 04/06/06 18:36:55] <ads-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, I primed the CN counter.  I missed the KA flyby.

[GMT 04/06/06 18:55:46] <JorgenJensen-GV> Passed the KA for the second time. Stunningly clear day with snow-covered mountains to the west.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:56:28] <ads-GV> Okay, thanks for the info Chris.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:57:03] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-G5, WCN is thirsty if liquid status light blinks fast. You can also monitor variable SFLCN_WCN (status flags). It is zero when WCN is happy.
[GMT 04/06/06 18:57:05] <schanot_jeffco> Going into 1300 meeting.  any last minute input?
[GMT 04/06/06 18:59:12] <ads-GV> Thaks for the info Dave.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:00:54] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-G5, if you feel adventurous, you could try sending WCN a command to inject water more frequently. The procedure involves typing a command at a terminal window on hyper.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:02:02] <ads-GV> I don't think that I'm that bold.  I would hate to mess it up by giving it to much to drink.

[GMT 04/06/06 19:06:41] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, I understand, but you can't hurt it. There is drain reservoir bottle, and it will automatically drain if too wet.  If it gets dried out again and stops making data, maybe try command then.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:09:07] <ads-GV> Okay, what is the command and where do I tytpe it?

[GMT 04/06/06 19:13:21] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads, g5- WCN command is three steps: 
[GMT 04/06/06 19:14:14] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5- first, rserial /dev/dsmser1 dsm308  (this will show 10Hz values updating on screen)
[GMT 04/06/06 19:15:45] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, second SIT,5   (followed by ENTER; this commands inject one shot every 5 sec)
[GMT 04/06/06 19:16:40] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, third Ctrl-D to exit talking to WCN.   If you want to know what current inject time is, type SIT (ENTER), then read fast.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:18:59] <ads-GV> Okay Dave I will give it a try in a bit.  We have another KA pass coming up.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:28:44] <ads-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, It looks like the current inject time is 15. Is that good enough?
[GMT 04/06/06 19:29:06] <JorgenJensen-GV> OPS: we are 3/4 through our KA intercomparison plan; we still have half an hour flight time here. Our decision is to do another race track, still at 18000 ft. The photography is difficult due to the passing speeds of the aircraft, and we would rather get more intercomparison data. We have contacted the KA and will attempt this. Thus we still plan for an unchanged meeting time with the BAE-146.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:30:42] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, try 10sec. Looks like WCN is not sending data after 19:27. You may have to send it command SM,4,1
[GMT 04/06/06 19:33:24] <JorgenJensen-GV> OPS: did you get my last message about extension of racetracks?
[GMT 04/06/06 19:34:00] <ads-GV> Dave, no the serial port is locked up.  It will not respond to the rsserial command.  Yhis is why I did not want to mess with it!!!!
[GMT 04/06/06 19:35:35] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, ok. Suggest WCN cycling power on WCN -- rocker switch where power cord enters.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:36:59] <JorgenJensen-GV> OPS: anybody there?
[GMT 04/06/06 19:38:19] <ads-GV> Looks like the whole DSM might be messed up, Cycled power on the DSM.
[GMT 04/06/06 19:39:51] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> JorgenJensen-GV try the TREX channel...
[GMT 04/06/06 19:42:12] <ads-GV> Cycling power fixed the DSM.  Lost ALL data on DSM 308 from 1927 thru 1940.  I do not recommend doing this again.

[GMT 04/06/06 20:33:10] <AlCooper-GV> DaveR-Jeffco If you're watching CHAT, I'd really appreciate it if I can ask you to relay a message to Jan. Are you online?
[GMT 04/06/06 20:34:10] <DaveR-Jeffco> Al- I am online, in conf room for inlet meeting. What's the message? 
[GMT 04/06/06 20:36:25] <AlCooper-GV> DaveR-Jeffco Please ask her (303-258-0470) not to cancel dinner reservations for tomorrow. No flight Friday (as I understand it). Sorry to interrupt meeting; this is not urgent, but probably can't wait until we land.
[GMT 04/06/06 20:38:24] <DaveR-Jeffco> Al- okay, I'll phone her after this meeting and let you know.
[GMT 04/06/06 20:41:44] <JeffStith-Jeffco> Al and Dave, I called Jan and gave her the message.  She will keep the reservation.

[GMT 04/06/06 21:23:53] <DaveR-Jeffco> AlCooper-G5, message was delivered (twice) to Jan. Your reservations are intact.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:23:55] <ads-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, The CN wanted water again.  I think I made it hibernate.  Now I am getting an error message and I'm not gettin any data.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:26:04] <ads-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, Please check CN data
[GMT 04/06/06 21:26:39] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-GV, I'll look at data, but we only get CONCN_WCR, not the status values, etc. 
[GMT 04/06/06 21:27:00] <AvapsOps> DaveR-Jeffco Thanks!
[GMT 04/06/06 21:30:31] <ads-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, it looks like it is working right now. Tereasa thinks that the message is a labview message and not effecting data.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:31:26] <ads-GV> We are curently desending to 1000 feet.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:31:45] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, I see 6 minutes of WCN zeroes, and numbers after that.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:31:58] <ads-GV> I noticed that the status flag went to 4 and the light was flashing for water so I gave it some.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:32:22] <ads-GV> I think the 0 were before I saw it  needed water.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:32:29] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, If you are seeing a Labview message, then you're looking at the RDMA screen, not WCN. 
[GMT 04/06/06 21:33:31] <ads-GV> That could be, I just know there is an error message on that computer now.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:33:41] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, WCN has consistently shown thirst when at high altitudes (>35kft) for extended periods (>1hr). Sometimes the cure has been to prime it, but sometimes you just have to wait.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:34:07] Nick change: AvapsOps -> AlCooper-GV
[GMT 04/06/06 21:35:16] <ads-GV> We have been below 25K since we left altitude from the ferry.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:35:43] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, Labview error message on RDMA laptop is bad juju.  If so, then the only solution is to shut down rdma system and restart from scratch. Only time I've seen that problem is when the display gets closed, or nearly closed. 
[GMT 04/06/06 21:38:20] <ads-GV> That is what happened as I was trying to prime the pump.  Teresa said that the RDMA was not onboard?
[GMT 04/06/06 21:38:52] <ads-GV> If you want us to restart let me knoiw but we are in the middle of a intercomparioson.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:40:06] <ads-GV> Is there not a way to turn that hiberbnate off?
[GMT 04/06/06 21:40:55] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, instructions for shutting down rdma are clipped below laptop. From shut down to start up should take about a minute, most of which is wating for laptop to reboot. 
[GMT 04/06/06 21:41:31] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, It's your choice to restart or ignore it. 
[GMT 04/06/06 21:42:14] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, I looked for hibernate avoidance but couldn't find it on Win98. It's probably there someplace.

[GMT 04/06/06 21:57:14] <ads-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, the computer does not respond to any inputs.
[GMT 04/06/06 21:57:56] <TCampos-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, Al is unable to exit LabView gracefully.  Will we risk data from earlier in the flight if we force an exit LV (using Task Manager, for example)?
[GMT 04/06/06 21:59:32] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, Ungraceful exit is okay. Hold down power button until Laptop powers off. Then power it up again and start rdma software. 
[GMT 04/06/06 22:00:02] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-g5, Earlier data are not at risk. Laptop opens a new file based on current clock time.
[GMT 04/06/06 22:01:08] <TCampos-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, Thanks much.  Al is re-starting the laptop now.
[GMT 04/06/06 22:02:04] <DaveR-Jeffco> Ilana and Teresa-G5, Looks like CN, ozone, water vapor, and CO follow similar traces during descent ~21:20 to 21:40.

[GMT 04/06/06 22:05:32] <TCampos-GV> DaveR-Jeffco, we're ok w/ rdma now.  Al is waiting for a full spectrum, but it is counting as it should.

[GMT 04/06/06 22:20:02] <JimMoore-Ops> JorgenJensen-GV, So Jan,  can you give me an updated eta?? Press is getting restless--
[GMT 04/06/06 22:21:10] <JorgenJensen-GV> 3:55 Bishop time
[GMT 04/06/06 22:22:31] <JorgenJensen-GV> BTW, there is no Jan onboard.
[GMT 04/06/06 22:25:16] <TCampos-GV> DaveR-Jeffco,  do you know what the lag time is for the WCN instrument/inlet?
[GMT 04/06/06 22:28:34] <JorgenJensen-GV> Passing over Coastal Range.
[GMT 04/06/06 22:29:56] <DaveR-Jeffco> Teresa-g5, It's hard to estimate, since we don't measure flow rate through inlet tubing, but I'd guess it's <2s. Within the instrument, the delay is short <~1s. 
[GMT 04/06/06 22:31:36] <DaveR-Jeffco> Looks like CN is picking up some narrow CN spikes, aircraft exhaust trails perhaps.
[GMT 04/06/06 22:32:53] <ads-GV> Yes there is traffic in the area.
[GMT 04/06/06 22:33:24] <ilana-GV> Dave, this is Teresa writing from Ilana's laptop.  The odd thing is that some CN spikes are not correlated with CO.
