[GMT 03/02/06 18:27:25] <BrianBillings-bishop> The 17 UTC sounding from Lemoore NAS is in. The upstream profile now has a well defined, very dry subsidence inversion just under 600 mb.
[GMT 03/02/06 18:31:25] <BrianBillings-bishop> The crest level winds are at 230 degrees and 20 knots. The strong shear level is still close to 600 mb.
[GMT 03/02/06 18:32:42] <perrywechsler-n2uw> We are right at the 600mb level, getting moderate chop, +-5m/s

[GMT 03/02/06 18:51:31] <BrianBillings-bishop> The 12 UTC COAMPS forecast is in, and it has significantly changed since last night. A strong wave is present at 03 UTC with an area of low-level turbulence and vertical isentropes that resembles a hydraulic jump. The intense wave now dies out by 15 UTC 03 March.
