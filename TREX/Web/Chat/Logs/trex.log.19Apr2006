[GMT 04/19/06 03:20:19] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> doing a few 'experiments' here with greg
[GMT 04/19/06 03:20:36] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> nice downslope flows have developed
[GMT 04/19/06 03:21:26] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> we are finishing up now and have dinner

[GMT 04/19/06 04:10:54] <BrianBillings-bishop> I see you set up x-chat out there. Good job. Has anyone else been on tonight?
[GMT 04/19/06 04:15:25] <AlexReinecke-ISFF> Hey Brian, I brought my own computer.  I think I may get in trouble for pluging it in to the internet here.
[GMT 04/19/06 04:18:16] <BrianBillings-bishop> If they didn'
[GMT 04/19/06 04:18:35] <BrianBillings-bishop> If they didn't have the foresight to set up chat, it's their own fault.
[GMT 04/19/06 04:20:44] <BrianBillings-bishop> I think that Thomas and I got a good record of the transition to downslope flow along the alluvial slope, although there were some northerlies during the start of the drive that will make the EOP people unhappy.
[GMT 04/19/06 04:22:56] <AlexReinecke-ISFF> Our 2030 PDT sonde showed very light northerlies all the way up.
[GMT 04/19/06 04:25:53] <BrianBillings-bishop> Those northerlies make sense. We actually saw a brief period of southerlies on the valley floor just before the sun set, so I guess the thermals were able to take hold near the end of the day.
[GMT 04/19/06 04:34:29] <AlexReinecke-ISFF> Yes, I was wondering if the northerlies were the nocturnal drainage or synoptically driven.  The are very light <= 5 kts
[GMT 04/19/06 04:43:16] <BrianBillings-bishop> Sorry to leave you on your own, but Thomas and I are going to drive tomorrow to capture the morning transition, so I'm calling it a night. Good luck with the rest of your launches. Hopefully, we can get more EOP chatters in the future.

[GMT 04/19/06 18:09:09] <BrianBillings-bishop> It appears the communication for this EOP is not working out too well.
[GMT 04/19/06 18:09:51] <MarkBradford-Boulder> How can I help?
[GMT 04/19/06 18:11:07] <MarkBradford-Boulder> As far as I can tell, you and I are the only ones on the chat server at the moment
[GMT 04/19/06 18:12:19] <BrianBillings-bishop> Yes. Stephan Dewekker and I were chatting at the start of the EOP and Alex and I were chatting last night, but not enough people want to use this resource.
[GMT 04/19/06 18:12:57] <MarkBradford-Boulder> It's popular with the aircraft, but seems like it hasn't spread to the ground-based sites
[GMT 04/19/06 18:52:41] <BrianBillings-bishop> The daily planning meeting is about to start, so I'm signing off for this EOP. Have a good afternoon.
