[GMT 03/25/06 14:44:23] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> It's warmed up a bit; broke 50 yesterday.  It's interesting at home, because utility work yesterday on 20th & Mapleton just outside my house apparently broke something...  They've been digging and working all night long.  No noticeable effect here, though.

[GMT 03/25/06 15:35:58] <AlCooper-G5> Dave Rogers or Chris Webster: WCN counter seems to be working OK as displayed on the unit but AEROS is showing counts of 0 and concentration of -32767. Suggestions? 
[GMT 03/25/06 15:37:22] <TeresaCampos-home> Al, ozone is not showing up on aeros.   Do the TDL counts display normally?
[GMT 03/25/06 15:40:55] <AlCooper-G5> Teresa, PP2F_LHL is about 540, PP2F_LHS about 130 to 170. We have problems with many variables and need someone to contact Chris W.
[GMT 03/25/06 15:46:41] <JamesDoyleGV> Steve:  Our catalog doesn't have any recent sounding data.  Can please you give us wind speed and direction at 700 mb and 4 km, height of the trop, and the height, speed and direction of the jet stream max?
[GMT 03/25/06 15:48:37] <TeresaCampos-home> Al, just reached Chris by phone; he's aware and will get on chat ASAP.
[GMT 03/25/06 15:52:29] <SteveWilliams-ops> James, the 14Z sounding shows the winds at 700mb (and 4 km) being SW at 25 m/s. The height of the trop is 200 mb, 12 km. The Jet max appears to be just below the trop at 11 km.

[GMT 03/25/06 20:38:28] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> new dust front coming in from the south after a relatively clear period, sunny skies at the moment
[GMT 03/25/06 20:40:14] <JamesDoyleGV> We're planning on dropping on our southern leg at FL430.  Clouds look more convective to the north and wave-like to the south.
[GMT 03/25/06 20:41:39] <SteveWilliams-ops> Surface winds have picked up again a bit with the mesonets. Still primarily Southeasterly. MAPR and ISS1 profilers showing 30 m/s at 1600 ft.

[GMT 03/25/06 20:50:40] <AlCooper-G5> We're planning drops along the northern leg over Independence on this next pass, because all other aircraft are out of the area. Data from sondes seems OK again, although we did lose a couple to the system problem.

[GMT 03/25/06 21:14:19] <JimMoore-Ops> In the Owens VAlley, surface winds at the north end have really increased

FL370 is near the tropopause, might be close to the tropopause break.  We are going to descend to FL330 to get some tropospheric information and do a circuit there.

[GMT 03/25/06 23:30:07] <JamesDoyleGV> We have completed our UTLS maneuvers at FL190.  It was a bit rough, so we did not do the speed maneuvers.

[GMT 03/25/06 23:40:44] <SteveWilliams-ops> The strong westerly sfc winds keep on blowing here (10-12 m/s). A few drops of rain at the ops center. The profilers also show strong westerlies aloft (> 50 kts)
[GMT 03/25/06 23:42:39] <JimMoore-Ops> JDoyleGV, Hey Jim King Air and BAe continue sampling across the Owens Valley  K/A reports flight generally smooth.
[GMT 03/25/06 23:43:26] <JimMoore-Ops> JDoyleGV, Did you do some of those soundings for the UTLS folks on the way back??

[GMT 03/25/06 23:44:06] <JDoyleGV> Interesting.  Our big news is that we had a nice encounter with a turbulent wave at FL450.  We hit +10 m/s up and 30K potential temp perturbations and 30 m/s wind velocity perturbations.  It was a good jolt.
[GMT 03/25/06 23:44:49] <JDoyleGV> Our ETA is 0020UTC
[GMT 03/25/06 23:45:12] <JimMoore-Ops> JDoyleGV, Where was this jolt?? Is this the one just before you left this area? or during the ferry??

[GMT 03/25/06 23:45:47] <JDoyleGV> Yes, this was the one when we were leaving the area on the truncated southern leg at 45kft.
