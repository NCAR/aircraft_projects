[GMT 04/13/06 15:22:52] <laptop4-g5> G'day JeffCo, all is well, however, we are flying at 42 kft in  the lower stratosphere, and both here and some distance below there are waves with +/- 1 m/s amplitudes. Not totally ideal, but probably unavoidable at high altitude.
[GMT 04/13/06 15:39:59] <AlCooper-Jeffco> Jorgen, that vertical-wind trace looks about as good as you could hope for, I think, for waves. It looks a little more turbulent that I would have expected, though; you must feel just a little occasional choppiness?

[GMT 04/13/06 21:12:41] <DaveR-Jeffco> Jorgen- two tiny cloud dots were in visible imagery GOES-E and -W. They moved east and dissipated.
