[GMT 03/10/06 01:49:49] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> 395 is great. I hope the ozone is ~ 1000ppbv. 
[GMT 03/10/06 01:52:24] <CrazyNO-G5> hi laura, O3 is only 250 ppb...highest we saw was ~500 at about 40 kft.

[GMT 03/10/06 01:54:48] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> Ilana, it is almost impossible to have 250 ppbv at 395K from my experience.  We need to check conversion factors.
[GMT 03/10/06 01:55:44] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> what was the tropopause level when you crossed it last?
[GMT 03/10/06 01:56:06] <CrazyNO-G5> conversion factors are correct...and all other signal from instrument say it is working well.
[GMT 03/10/06 01:57:50] <CrazyNO-G5> cannot remember what alt we saw TP but during the sounding on the way out here it was between 25 and 36 kft.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:00:09] <BrianBillings-bishop> The 00 UTC sounding from Oakland gives the tropopause at 338 mb, while the core of the jet is at 251 mb, 280 degrees at 111 knots. The sounding has not yet destabilized as much as forecast in the next few hours.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:03:16] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> If 338 mb ~ 30Kft  we are 4+ km above the tropopause.  The ozone should be a lot higher then 250 ppb... If not 1000 ppbv but at 395 K we should see at lease ~ 600 ppbv.. Let's just watch and see what else can be a factor for the unusually low ozone...

[GMT 03/10/06 02:21:19] <JamesDoyle-NRL> Any updates from the GV?
[GMT 03/10/06 02:26:39] <JorgenJensen-G5> ETA 9:15 MST for HIAPER - Bishop, please acknowledge a debrief time around 9:30, maybe a bit before.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:27:39] <dirks2_> okay we'll be ready about 9:20.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:30:09] <JorgenJensen-G5> Many thanks, Dick

[GMT 03/10/06 02:40:54] <ronsmith_GV> jim: we are homeward bound.  we found some waves (not too large) even at 47kft.

[GMT 03/10/06 02:45:05] <ronsmith_GV> The longer racetracks used to day are muc better scientifically. They do take a lot longer however. We can only do two stacks and few extra things.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:51:21] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> Ron and Ilana, I have been looking at the forecast cross section - almost look like there is a double tropopuase situation over the region with a hint of a higher troupopause near 360K.  I will look at a large scale later tonight and see if that explains the low ozone.  Unusual but if true it may turn out to be interesting. 
[GMT 03/10/06 02:52:14] <JorgenJensen-G5> Yes, that is the way I would also describe the soundings in the upper atmosphere we have seen today.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:52:39] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> 360 K theta level and 200 mb.  I will love to see the skewT tomorrow.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:53:06] <CrazyNO-G5> laura, we are setting up to do another sounding in the same spot as on the way out...we are at 45 kft right now, then we will drop to near 25, then back up to 35 and head for home.  I'm hoping that this gives us a better idea of what is ahppening in these two locations
[GMT 03/10/06 02:54:09] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> Jorgen, thanks for your comments.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:54:58] <CrazyNO-G5> To further explain:  If I recall correctly, O3 concetration looked reasonably normal during the sounding on the way out...it was only when we crossed the NV/CA border (very near where the TP dip was predicted in the RUC plots today) that I noticed a wierd inversion at alts above 40 kft.
[GMT 03/10/06 02:56:53] <CrazyNO-G5> In fact as we approach home at constant alt, [O3] has been slowly climbing, now at 350 ppb at 45 kft

[GMT 03/10/06 03:02:39] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> I have just looked up the 0Z cross section we had earlier.  There is a hint of a low PV streamer over the top of the jet core, all the way home at ~ 370 K potential temperature and 200mb. If during the dip, we see another inversion in ozone profile, meaning higher ozone value at lower level, we may have caught an very interesting case of mixing of tropical UT into midlat LS. 
[GMT 03/10/06 03:03:24] <CrazyNO-G5> very awesome!!!
[GMT 03/10/06 03:04:25] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> Other people (Europeans) have written papers about it. I think the cases they report was either march or may.
[GMT 03/10/06 03:05:01] <CrazyNO-G5> cool...i'm keeping my eyes peeled on the output
[GMT 03/10/06 03:05:14] <CrazyNO-G5> we just increased to 400 ppb at same alt
[GMT 03/10/06 03:05:29] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> what's your alt and theta?
[GMT 03/10/06 03:06:20] <CrazyNO-G5> alt is 45 kft, and theta = 388
[GMT 03/10/06 03:08:32] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> okay, let's keep watching. 
[GMT 03/10/06 03:09:47] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> When I said ozone should be high at 395 it is for mid to high lat conditions. If we in effect sampled tropical air, these lower values would be all right. 
[GMT 03/10/06 03:10:39] <CrazyNO-G5> we've started sounding

[GMT 03/10/06 03:12:52] <CrazyNO-G5> as we decend I did see a drop in O3 to 250 ppb, as we continue to decent O3 is back up to 500 ppb
[GMT 03/10/06 03:13:17] <CrazyNO-G5> low point was about 42 kft and we are approaching 39
[GMT 03/10/06 03:13:52] <CrazyNO-G5> oops past 39 approaching 35 kft and now O3 dropped back down to 360 ppb
[GMT 03/10/06 03:14:14] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> did you say the low ozone point was around 42K?
[GMT 03/10/06 03:14:49] <CrazyNO-G5> so far, then it went back up, now as we contuinue to dive it is down to 250
[GMT 03/10/06 03:15:29] <CrazyNO-G5> 100 at 27 kft
[GMT 03/10/06 03:15:46] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> now you hit the tropopause
[GMT 03/10/06 03:15:53] <CrazyNO-G5> h2o is way up now too
[GMT 03/10/06 03:16:18] <LauraPan-not-on-GV> what was h2o like when you had the ozone dip up high?
[GMT 03/10/06 03:16:19] <CrazyNO-G5> indeed, O3 down to 60 leveling alt at 25 kft
[GMT 03/10/06 03:18:38] <CrazyNO-G5> well up high h2o is not too prominent, but would need to look closer at data, sometimes hard to tell because of random noise spikes that offset the vertical scale...but at some points below 40 kft h20 is for the most part anti-corr with O3

[GMT 03/10/06 03:20:30] <CrazyNO-G5> so I do think we are seeing the double TP thing...O3 spiked on decent around 37/38 kft

[GMT 03/10/06 03:31:53] <JamesDoyle-NRL> Laura:  I noticed the water vapor images had some nice signatures of maybe a trop fold with some smaller scale structures in it.  I'll send you an image.
[GMT 03/10/06 03:32:15] <LauraPan-GV> Thank you Jim.
[GMT 03/10/06 03:32:44] <LauraPan-GV> my connection dropped for a brief moment when I try to look up latest GFS on awips
[GMT 03/10/06 03:33:43] <LauraPan-GV> looks like there is a low pv streamer across the area. Typically they are attributed to large scale wave breaking 
[GMT 03/10/06 03:40:05] <LauraPan-GV> from the 0Z to 06Z Friday, there is a low PV pocket sitting on top of our area. They should catch another inversion if approaching from high altitude but GV is already way down ~ 25Kft. Oh well.
[GMT 03/10/06 03:41:06] <CrazyNO-G5> reagent NO is also off for O3 instrument now in prep for landing
[GMT 03/10/06 03:43:21] <LauraPan-GV> Ilana, guard these data with your life I want to see them :-)
[GMT 03/10/06 03:44:24] <CrazyNO-G5> yes, indeed!  will try to get a chance to plot up tomorrow and share with you, but may be occupied with cal
[GMT 03/10/06 03:45:15] <CrazyNO-G5> ok landing now...later
