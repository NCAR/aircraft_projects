[GMT 03/25/06 15:17:52] <JamesDoyleGV> Any windows XP experts:  My laptop display on the GV is dim when the AC is plugged in and gets brighter when unplugged.  I looked around the control panel, but can't seem to find the display brightness option.  Any suggestions?
[GMT 03/25/06 15:17:55] <GregPoulos-G5> Teresa - the CO numbers are not showing up. After I hit 'start' it goes through a few things and then a screen that says 'averaging signal'. Then it goes back to the screen with a bunch of options. Is it doing something in the background and so it will take awhile for numbers to show up?
[GMT 03/25/06 15:21:43] <MarkBradford-Bishop> JamesDoyleGV, most laptops have brightness controls on the function keys, usually toward the upper left of the keyboard
[GMT 03/25/06 15:22:05] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Look for keys with little lightbulbs or suns on them -- you'll probably need to use your Fn key to activate them
[GMT 03/25/06 15:22:08] <ilana-G5> was wondering if anyone had a suggestion on how to fix XO3 channel feed to Aeros.  O3 data is fine at my station and is being recorded here, but the real time data is not transmitting to Aeros.
[GMT 03/25/06 15:23:33] <TeresaCampos-home> Greg, try a hard re-boot again, and this time skip the calibration initiation sequence.  Thanks for catching that quickly!
[GMT 03/25/06 15:23:48] <MarkBradford-Bishop> JamesDoyleGV, I looked around at some of the other laptops in the ops center, and one of them had the brightness controls on the up-and-down arrow keys, so there's another place to look

[GMT 03/25/06 16:25:51] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> You have a connection to the ground.  We are talking, and I can ping.  The data to the ground has not recovered yet, and I'm on it.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:26:29] <DaveAllbee_GV> ok thanks
[GMT 03/25/06 16:26:54] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> ChrisWebster-Boulder, are you restarting ldm on malbec?

[GMT 03/25/06 16:27:28] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Yes, Chris, he restarted it at 8:30
[GMT 03/25/06 16:27:32] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I'm trying to but keep getting 'Waiting for the LDM to terminate'
[GMT 03/25/06 16:28:01] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Will it not terminate if it's dealing with a product?
[GMT 03/25/06 16:28:51] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> I'm not sure what keeps it from terminating.  It just happens sometimes.  I end up doing "killall -9 rpc.ldmd", then "ldmadmin stop", then "ldmadmin start", and crossing my fingers. :-)
[GMT 03/25/06 16:29:03] <birwin-ncar> dave, this is bill, kurt saw some "cables" hanging near the dsm that may be ox3 and the other analog that's missing, is anything nearby?
[GMT 03/25/06 16:30:08] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ldm:  says it restarted now (after using CB's sledgehammer).
[GMT 03/25/06 16:32:05] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> Dave/Bill there are 3 analog cables, with all 8 ports available (labeled A0, A1, etc), all hanging there.  $10 says we plugged the wrong one back in after the PLWC work last week.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:32:41] <ilana-G5> all analogs were unplugged...we're back online now
[GMT 03/25/06 16:33:03] <birwin-ncar> chris, according to kurt, no one played the dsm's, only plwc at mount location
[GMT 03/25/06 16:35:29] <ChrisBurghart-Boulder> ChrisWebster-Boulder, data is flowing to malbec now.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:35:59] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> ChrisBurghart-Boulder Good, I actually just did another restart 1 minute ago because I didn't see anything.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:37:09] <DaveAllbee_GV> There was a Calibration done to that dsms a/d cards
[GMT 03/25/06 16:37:32] <AlCooper-G5> ChrisWebster-Boulder Thanks for the help, we're looking OK now.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:37:50] <DaveAllbee_GV> when the volt ref was taken away things were not plugged back in
[GMT 03/25/06 16:38:10] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Don't see the GV tracks on the IDV yet, we'll keep looking
[GMT 03/25/06 16:39:19] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> look like older data is still coming down, it's just starting to catch up.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:40:22] <DaveAllbee_GV> birwin, tell kurt he saved the day

[GMT 03/25/06 16:45:23] <birwin-ncar> cool, good fix, so we're all good now, correct?
[GMT 03/25/06 16:46:04] <ilana-G5> XO3 is good and correct as far as I can tell, so I think all is okay now
[GMT 03/25/06 16:46:58] <ilana-G5> as soon as cables were plugged in again, all was normal, so probably all okay now
[GMT 03/25/06 16:47:02] <ChrisWebster-Boulder> I still need to try to get WCN going.
[GMT 03/25/06 16:47:09] <DaveAllbee_GV> i hope so, just getting ready to enjoy a nice burrito... THANKS
[GMT 03/25/06 16:51:10] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> it starts to look very impressive from the valley floor. Huge foehnwall and visibility to the south rapidly decreasing
