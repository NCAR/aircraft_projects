[GMT 04/18/06 22:03:50] <BrianBillings-bishop> Unfortunately, winds are still northerly at the three ISS surface stations, although ISS2 does have an easterly component (upslope?).
[GMT 04/18/06 22:18:18] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> Brian - the first launch of the EOP is at 3pm PDT, correct?
[GMT 04/18/06 22:18:57] <BrianBillings-bishop> Actually, the first launch is at 4pm PDT. That is the offical start of the EOP.
[GMT 04/18/06 22:21:08] <BrianBillings-bishop> Unfortunately, since these soundings are launched from Independence, we cannot view them in real time, and chat is not available at the ISFF trailor.
[GMT 04/18/06 22:25:31] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> ok, thanks, Are the balloons not launched from the airport then?
[GMT 04/18/06 22:26:30] <BrianBillings-bishop> All of the EOP soundings are launched from the Independence airport. If they were launched from MAPR, they would be accessible by catalog or chat.
[GMT 04/18/06 22:29:25] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> that's a bummer that they are not on chat. Will have to call them then. Woudl you or soemone else at the ops center be able to do that and report significant events to the people on Xchat?
[GMT 04/18/06 22:32:20] <BrianBillings-bishop> Unfortunately (I'm typing that word alot), only Alex and I are at the ops center now. He will be leaving to launch the sondes, and I'll be leaving to drive with Thomas in the instrumented car.
[GMT 04/18/06 22:33:18] <BrianBillings-bishop> If you have a phone there, the number at the ISFF trailer is 213-291-3289. Or you I could ask Alex or someone else to call you.
[GMT 04/18/06 22:35:42] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> Thanks, I'll give them a call then if I want some info
[GMT 04/18/06 22:36:13] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> where exactly are you going to drive with the instrumented car?
[GMT 04/18/06 22:40:44] <BrianBillings-bishop> Thomas will be in charge of that. Usually, we drive repeated cross-sections along the Onion Valley and Mazourka Canyon roads. Although, if you have any suggestions, I'll be sure to pass them along. Perhaps, more repetitions along the Onion Valley road would be better.
[GMT 04/18/06 22:46:19] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> I was wondering if you could do a few cross sections along the valley axis at Foothills road, from the x-section with Onion Valley Road to a few hundred meters south of the DRI met station. A transition from upslope to downlope occurs there around 5:30 or so and it would be nice to capture that

[GMT 04/18/06 23:03:20] <BrianBillings-bishop> I talked with Thomas, and he said that we can do the Foothills road cross sections. We're leaving at 4:30, so we'll start them soon after we arrive in the study area.

[GMT 04/18/06 23:08:02] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> That would be great! I'll keep my eyes peeled for the wacky car!
[GMT 04/18/06 23:19:37] <BrianBillings-bishop> Thomas and I are heading out now. You can try to contact me at 775-376-3364, but I may not get a signal if were are driving too fast. I'll try to check back in later this evening. Good luck with the EOP.
