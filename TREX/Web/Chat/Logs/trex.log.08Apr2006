[GMT 04/08/06 14:55:44] <AlCooper-GV> Ops: Beautiful smooth waves on the southern leg at FL430. Unusual structure in ozone must indicate complex layering. Still about 3 m/s amplitude.

[GMT 04/08/06 15:14:08] <AlCooper-GV> JimMoore-Ops Thanks, Jim. We have encountered series of waves on both the northern and southern legs, with the ones on the south having larger amplitude. At FL430, waves over Independence were much smoother than at FL400 but of about the same amplitude. An interesting stratospheric structure, with horizontal gradients and layers in ozone.
[GMT 04/08/06 15:16:30] <N2UW> we found 4 waves of 14 km length @ FL190  w around 2.5 m/s 
[GMT 04/08/06 15:19:50] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim--how deep is this layer of easterly wind in the valley? 
[GMT 04/08/06 15:20:51] <N2UW> we can observe snow blowed off the ridge crest - must be strong wind there
[GMT 04/08/06 15:22:26] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Lidar data suggests under 500m thick
[GMT 04/08/06 15:22:54] <JimMoore-Ops> N2UW--Probably your prop wash!!

[GMT 04/08/06 15:26:07] <AlCooper-GV> N2UW We see wave sequences at FL400 and FL430 that start about over Independence and extend about 50 n mi to the NW. How does that correspond to the location of the waves you are seeing?
[GMT 04/08/06 15:26:24] <AlCooper-GV> -- correction: to the NE - sorry
[GMT 04/08/06 15:26:49] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim--do we still have strong returns from the windprofiers? 
[GMT 04/08/06 15:27:50] <N2UW> our waves start upstream the sierra crest
[GMT 04/08/06 15:29:07] <N2UW> @ fl 160 we have 6 waves of 14 km wavelength with 3.5 m/s max w
[GMT 04/08/06 15:29:42] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, ISS-1 30kts at ridge top, MAPR is weak aloft, no more than 2 km
[GMT 04/08/06 15:30:19] <Vanda-HIAPER> The estimated wavelength at FL400 and FL430 is about 18 km. 
[GMT 04/08/06 15:31:18] <SteveWilliams-ops> Mark, we now get the "Verizon is having technical difficulties. Please call back later" message when we call NCAR!

[GMT 04/08/06 16:33:10] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim--Thanks. We are also seeing some of the nice wave structure found earlier diminished in amplitude. 
[GMT 04/08/06 16:34:33] <SteveWilliams-ops> Update from the valley floor... Sfc winds remain southerly but very light (< 2 m/s)
[GMT 04/08/06 16:38:50] <N2UW> at fl 220 still waves detectable, but weaker now, w <= 2 m/s
[GMT 04/08/06 16:46:00] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, So it appears we are documenting the cessation of the wave event.  Still it seems early on we had motion to high levels
[GMT 04/08/06 16:49:02] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---The amplitude at FL430 has dropped from (-2.5,+4) m/s to (-1,+3) m/s in 1.5 hours. The numbers in the parentheses are min and max w.
[GMT 04/08/06 16:52:04] <N2UW> at fl 190  we have vertical wind -3.5, + 2.5 
[GMT 04/08/06 16:52:29] <N2UW> same strength as on the first leg at fl 190
[GMT 04/08/06 16:55:28] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Roger that

[GMT 04/08/06 17:19:33] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Finally a couple of small wave clouds appear just downwind the crest, south of Bishop
[GMT 04/08/06 17:21:31] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---Is King Air flight still on schedule to land in Bishop at 17:30 UTC? 
[GMT 04/08/06 17:22:24] <N2UW> we plan to land between 17:40 and 7:45
[GMT 04/08/06 17:22:50] <N2UW> 17:45 UTC
[GMT 04/08/06 17:25:10] <N2UW> wave at ridge crest (-4 , +2.7) m/s @ fl 160
[GMT 04/08/06 17:25:16] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---thanks for the visual confirmation of wave clouds in Bishop. There seems to be a thin cirrus wave cloud above Independence. 
[GMT 04/08/06 17:27:06] <SteveWilliams-ops> We can see a very thin cirrus to our south, but still very clear all around with the exception of a few small wave clouds to our south
[GMT 04/08/06 17:27:55] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> We are seeing nice waves in aerosol layers between 3and 5km agl
[GMT 04/08/06 17:28:13] <StephanDeWekker-REAL> in the last 30 minutes
[GMT 04/08/06 17:32:45] <N2UW> we just terminated the leg at fl 160 and are now flying back to Bishop
[GMT 04/08/06 17:33:05] <AlCooper-GV> Only weak waves (amplitude about 1 m/s) on the last racetrack at FL400. Significant decrease in wave amplitude in comparison to our first passes.
[GMT 04/08/06 17:34:33] <AlCooper-GV> N2UW We copied that. We;ll still refrain from dropping on the N leg because the BAe is still in the area.

[GMT 04/08/06 18:04:58] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Larry is reluctant to fly KA this PM.  He is over talking to Jim D. Now--  Your thoughts on second KA flight for this PM appreciated
[GMT 04/08/06 18:05:44] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, LArry also believes we will have 'better' opportunity tomorrow during the day maybe a bit later than today was
[GMT 04/08/06 18:06:08] <SteveWilliams-ops> Update from the Valley floor... Sfc wind speeds have increased to ~4 m/s over the past hour. Direction more SE.
[GMT 04/08/06 18:06:17] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---Please, give me an update of the surface and remote-sensor obs. 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:06:46] <JimMoore-Ops> We may be able to cobble an upstream sonde from Lemoore at 23Z tomorrow
[GMT 04/08/06 18:06:56] <Vanda-HIAPER> Steve---thanks. You guessed my next question. Please, continue with the wind profilers, lidars, etc.

[GMT 04/08/06 18:08:59] <SteveWilliams-ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Call it great minds!!! Anyway, the profilers are not showing very high returns, but profiles below ridge line are light and southerly.
[GMT 04/08/06 18:09:38] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---Do you mean to extend IOP to fit a mid-day or an afternoon King Air flight? 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:10:11] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Jim D just came in the room from the KA.  Said flight was good
[GMT 04/08/06 18:10:38] <SteveWilliams-ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Vertical velocities from MAPR remain 1-2 m/s; variable and light over the past hour. No real trend here.....
[GMT 04/08/06 18:10:59] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, IOP 10, as scheduled lasts until 18Z tomorrow--matter is if we extend later tomorrow
[GMT 04/08/06 18:12:42] <Vanda-HIAPER> I concur with Larry about the afternoon flight. Let's see what the options are for tomorrow. I don't see the new COAMPS run in the catalog yet. My read of the forecast last night is that winds to pick up in the afternoon, and the moisture might be O.K. into the late afternoon. 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:17:54] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim---your last sentence was cut off. 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:20:09] <Vanda-HIAPER> Steve---are both JimD and JimM away from chat? 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:21:39] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Hi Vanda,  We are here--well I am here and Jim is conferring with LArry A
[GMT 04/08/06 18:23:45] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER,  I just noted that IOP-10 is now scheduled to continue until 18Z tomorrow morning
[GMT 04/08/06 18:25:00] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Back to today--Decision by Jim and Larry is to delay KA takeoff to at least 1300 to allow heating to maybe strengthen gradient and coupling
[GMT 04/08/06 18:26:25] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Can you confirm departure time from area--I estimate 2030Z?? (1230p local, 1330p MDT)??
[GMT 04/08/06 18:28:07] <Vanda-HIAPER> Our departure is likely to be close to 19:30 UTC. 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:29:08] <Vanda-HIAPER> Regarding the afternoon KA flight. The later, the better. 
[GMT 04/08/06 18:31:07] <JimMoore-Ops> Vanda-HIAPER, Right you are-- got my time zones confused--

[GMT 04/08/06 18:56:30] <SteveWilliams-ops> Update from the valley floor.... sfc windspeeds have increased a bit to ~5 m/s, still out of the S-SE. No visible dust though
[GMT 04/08/06 19:00:03] <SteveWilliams-ops> Profilers show southerly winds near the surface changing to SW (20-30 knys) near ridgetop and above.

[GMT 04/08/06 19:12:24] <SteveWilliams-ops> Update on BAe position:  08/04/06 1907Z	     	 36°24.4N	     	118°52.0W	     	 28639 ft
[GMT 04/08/06 19:12:40] <AlCooper-GV> Pilots confirm they have left the area, and 2nd check will be ATC that has both our positions.
[GMT 04/08/06 19:13:20] <SteveWilliams-ops> That was our thought, but we have a delay here on the position updating, so I wanted you to confirm!
[GMT 04/08/06 19:13:21] <AlCooper-GV> SteveWilliams-ops Thanks, that confirms they are out of the area of the drops.
[GMT 04/08/06 19:14:45] <SteveWilliams-ops> Happy dropping! Give us a new crop to harvest!
[GMT 04/08/06 19:25:34] <AlCooper-GV> Dropsondes are on the way down, and we're leaving the area now.
[GMT 04/08/06 19:26:09] <MarkBradford-Boulder> To harvest, unless they happen to fall in the lake :)
[GMT 04/08/06 19:26:10] <AlCooper-GV> But before we go, there is great interest here in the plan for tomorrow?
[GMT 04/08/06 19:26:44] <SteveWilliams-ops> Good job! Have a safe return home. Stay tuned for updates. The discussion is going on right now...
[GMT 04/08/06 19:28:31] <LauraPan-GV> Al, I am in the planning meeting right now and I can relay you the unofficial version of the meeting if that's interested.will let you know what I heard soon. Right now, they are talking aboiut
[GMT 04/08/06 19:28:41] <SteveWilliams-ops> Larry Armi proposes an afternoon King Air flight with BAe. BAe could drop sondes as well
[GMT 04/08/06 19:30:19] <AlCooper-GV> LauraPan-GV Thanks, Laura, but we can wait for the decision. 
[GMT 04/08/06 19:30:34] <SteveWilliams-ops> BAe proposes a chemistry flight in the morning and a wave flight in the afternoon
[GMT 04/08/06 19:31:46] <SteveWilliams-ops> Any comments back from HIAPER on any interest in an afternoon flight tomorrow?
[GMT 04/08/06 19:32:27] <Vanda-HIAPER> Steve, can you give me a quick update on the forecast discussion. Althernately, I could upload the catalog but might last longer than your typing. 
[GMT 04/08/06 19:33:19] <SteveWilliams-ops> The forecast discussion was not promising for the morning, but looking better for the afternoon. But we will not have any soundings as the IOP ends 18Z
[GMT 04/08/06 19:33:53] <SteveWilliams-ops> The discussion here seems to think it's a marginal case for the HIAPER
[GMT 04/08/06 19:34:36] <Vanda-HIAPER> Can you give me forecasted ridge top winds? 
[GMT 04/08/06 19:35:04] <SteveWilliams-ops> About 20 knots or so....
[GMT 04/08/06 19:35:21] <Vanda-HIAPER> I agree that it might be tricky to catch it. The lower level aircrat are better suited for that. 
[GMT 04/08/06 19:35:32] <Vanda-HIAPER> What is the outlook for Tuesday? 
[GMT 04/08/06 19:36:40] <SteveWilliams-ops> That is the feeling here on Tomorrow. 
[GMT 04/08/06 19:37:05] <SteveWilliams-ops> Possible IOP on Tuesday. Looking better....
[GMT 04/08/06 19:38:38] <SteveWilliams-ops> So it looks like a possible 2 aircraft mission tomorrow afternoon with dropsondes....

[GMT 04/08/06 19:56:50] <SteveWilliams-ops> And if the BAe does drops in the Owens Valley then that will be a bonus!

[GMT 04/08/06 20:27:35] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I get a 'call cannot be completed' message

[GMT 04/08/06 20:57:07] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Try sending direct to mark@eol.ucar.edu, that way it won't have to go through the servers at ML
[GMT 04/08/06 20:58:50] <SteveWilliams-ops> OK, let me find it in my "sent" folder and resend. I will let you know when it goes through.

[GMT 04/08/06 22:15:45] <N2UW> yes please, the latest sounding from the valley, from whatever source
[GMT 04/08/06 22:20:57] <heather_bishop> Hi, there's an inversion between about 740 and 700 mb.  Hard to tell how strong maybe about 2 or 3 degrees C.  The winds are northerly in the lowest 250 to 300 mb and are WSW above that and look fairly vigorous.  The air is conditionally unstable above 700 mb and pretty stable below about 740.   Let me know if you need more info.

[GMT 04/08/06 22:37:35] <heather_bishop> Hi, that was actually from the latest mapr sounding.  I can check another sounding if need be.  
[GMT 04/08/06 22:37:50] <N2UW> Heather, are you getting our tracks ok?
[GMT 04/08/06 22:38:38] <heather_bishop> Looks like your over the Inyos right now.  Let me know if that's wrong.  
[GMT 04/08/06 22:39:30] <heather_bishop> Can you please confirm your take off time and are there any waves?
