[GMT 04/02/06 15:46:42] <Errol-G5> We are having a flood of the coffee and sink water at the moment, mopping up
[GMT 04/02/06 15:48:36] <MarkBradford-Bishop> This isn't a hydrology experiment, Errol

[GMT 04/02/06 15:53:32] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> Also: shutoff valve just aft of the galley on outer skin down towards the floor. One is marked 'galley water'; turn that off. Please acknowledge receipt.

[GMT 04/02/06 15:55:54] <StuartBeaton-home> Jorgen, I just connected, got the three messages about talking to Beasley

[GMT 04/02/06 18:13:28] <DaveA_GV> the username/password should be unique to his machine

[GMT 04/02/06 18:14:14] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> DaveA_GV  Errol's computer mounts one of our disks.  I'm assuming he needs the password for that, and it is the same as the ads password.

[GMT 04/02/06 18:17:10] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> right.  So try 'ads' 'avaps' or 'hyper' or 'gv'
[GMT 04/02/06 18:17:19] <DaveA_GV> ok
[GMT 04/02/06 18:18:58] <DaveA_GV> no luck

[GMT 04/02/06 18:28:51] <TCampos-g5> We asked Errol to try both passwords with user 'avaps', but no luck.  HIs cptr had opened many (innumerable) login dialog boxes.  Do you all think maybe problem either related to this freak, or may have been locked out by too many attempts?
[GMT 04/02/06 18:35:33] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> The former; Errol is a red;oak freak.  I doubt the computer locked him out.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:38:00] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> DaveA_GV if you go over to the camera laptop, on terminal window, can you type 'df' and tell me if one of the line items has 'hyper:/mnt/r2' or 'gv:/mnt/r2' in it?
[GMT 04/02/06 18:38:53] <DaveA_GV> ok
[GMT 04/02/06 18:41:17] <DaveA_GV> it is gv:/mnt...
[GMT 04/02/06 18:42:50] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ok. 
[GMT 04/02/06 18:43:04] <DaveA_GV> well?
[GMT 04/02/06 18:43:27] <DaveA_GV> i'm giving up on errol
[GMT 04/02/06 18:44:00] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I don't know the name of that computer, so I can't log into it from here.  We are probably stuck until/if Stuart comes back on line.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:44:18] <JorgenJensen-JeffCo> :q
[GMT 04/02/06 18:45:13] <DaveA_GV> it's fedora

[GMT 04/02/06 18:51:44] <TCampos-g5> Chris and Dave, there's also a label on it that says, ' C130 ground support'
[GMT 04/02/06 18:52:33] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Errol is that ip the camera or your computer?  Did you get samba yet?
[GMT 04/02/06 18:53:08] <Errol-G5> the IP and name is my computer
[GMT 04/02/06 18:53:23] <Errol-G5> I did not get ssamba yet
[GMT 04/02/06 18:55:03] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I can try restarting samba on the server.  the username config file has 'avaps'.  And since it's mapping to the 'ads' user on the server, I assume it's the same password.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:55:35] <Errol-G5> yes red;oak
[GMT 04/02/06 18:55:55] <Errol-G5> that is how we logged in before
[GMT 04/02/06 18:57:31] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> ok I restarted the samba server, try again.
[GMT 04/02/06 18:58:37] <Errol-G5> no dice
[GMT 04/02/06 18:59:15] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> TCampos-g5 can you type ' /sbin/ifconfig -a' on the camera computer and on the 2nd line of output, should say 'inet addr: ...', can you give me that number?
[GMT 04/02/06 19:00:54] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Errol-G5 I can't ping your computer, do you have networking?
[GMT 04/02/06 19:01:10] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> You must if your on chat....
[GMT 04/02/06 19:02:20] <Errol-G5> I am on chat - dropps arre restarting
[GMT 04/02/06 19:02:45] <TCampos-g5> Ok, here is the inet addr: 192.168.84.207
[GMT 04/02/06 19:08:25] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Camera won't work because the disk drive is out of i-nodes, it can't create any more files.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:12:11] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> Errol-G5 try again when you are done with drops.  You and the Camera mount the same disk.  I removed some files to make room.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:14:31] <TCampos-g5> sue successfully re-started the camera now.  thx, chris
[GMT 04/02/06 19:15:03] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> please don't, it will run out of i-nodes in seconds.

[GMT 04/02/06 19:30:31] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I've moved 3 flights of camera pictures off the disk, so you should be able to restart the camera and hopefully this will fix the dropsonde connection also.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:30:52] <jcowan-home> Hey Dave, Hows the flight going.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:30:57] <ChrisWebster-Jeffco> I'm out for a couple hours.  cell = 303-229-5926
[GMT 04/02/06 19:31:00] <DaveA_GV> is there a secret to running the coffee pot on the gv
[GMT 04/02/06 19:31:13] <jcowan-home> What's it doing?
[GMT 04/02/06 19:31:23] <DaveA_GV> shortly after takeoff there was a flood
[GMT 04/02/06 19:31:30] <DaveA_GV> and i do mean flood
[GMT 04/02/06 19:32:04] ChrisWebster-Jeffco (cjw@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[GMT 04/02/06 19:32:28] <jcowan-home> The silver button over the coffe pot used to fill the water got stuck.  Press it a couple of times and that stop it.  you can also tuen off the water service with the switches over the galley.

[GMT 04/02/06 19:34:11] <DaveA_GV> well, i hit it once like i was taught and was facing fwd for takeoff so i didn't see what was happening.  someone got my attention and there was water everywhere
[GMT 04/02/06 19:34:39] <jcowan-home> Hmm, is it still leaking?
[GMT 04/02/06 19:35:05] <DaveA_GV> i think ALL of the water onboard went through the coffee pot and onto the floor
[GMT 04/02/06 19:35:12] <DaveA_GV> i think it is all gone
[GMT 04/02/06 19:35:23] <DaveA_GV> but we did turn off the valves
[GMT 04/02/06 19:36:12] <DaveA_GV> don't tell bill but the auto defib machine was swimming
[GMT 04/02/06 19:36:21] <jcowan-home> Well it sounds like it's a real mess. Unless they want coffee I would leave it off until you get back and let the Mechs deal with it.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:36:40] <jcowan-home> I just hope it was not on <g>..
[GMT 04/02/06 19:36:59] <DaveA_GV> sounds like a plan
[GMT 04/02/06 19:37:55] <jcowan-home> Other then that any issues?

[GMT 04/02/06 19:40:25] <DaveA_GV> nope
[GMT 04/02/06 19:40:32] <DaveA_GV> all is well
[GMT 04/02/06 19:41:00] <DaveA_GV> one aperature cover fell during takeoff, no major injuries
[GMT 04/02/06 19:42:18] <jcowan-home> I'm glad to heat that there was no blood.  I'll keep monitoring If you want, no active just look at it occassionally.

[GMT 04/02/06 19:45:19] <jcowan-home> Did you get most of the water cleaned up? Or did most of it flow down under the floor?
[GMT 04/02/06 19:45:45] <DaveA_GV> did as much as i could
[GMT 04/02/06 19:46:14] <DaveA_GV> there is going to be a lot of maintenance done when we get back
[GMT 04/02/06 19:46:31] <jcowan-home> Okay, last time we had an issue with the water supply in the back we had a mini iceflow under the floor.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:46:50] <jcowan-home> Maintenance, Mechs or us?
[GMT 04/02/06 19:47:00] <DaveA_GV> that sounds bad
[GMT 04/02/06 19:47:10] <DaveA_GV> mechs probably
[GMT 04/02/06 19:47:14] <DaveA_GV> or both
[GMT 04/02/06 19:49:06] <jcowan-home> Okay, well at least you got it stopped.  We will see what they say for a flight tomorrow as to how important it is to get everthing perfect tonight.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:50:30] <birwin-ncar> no flight tomorrow, plenty of time to get the samboni out to resurface the ice under the floor tomorrow
[GMT 04/02/06 19:51:29] <DaveA_GV> bill did you happen to hear about your defib machine???
[GMT 04/02/06 19:51:36] <jcowan-home> Okay, well that good.  It took 2 days last time to get the carpet dried out from the last flood.
[GMT 04/02/06 19:51:44] <DaveA_GV> i have it line drying in the lav
[GMT 04/02/06 19:53:20] <DaveA_GV> it will need to be tested out tomorrow
