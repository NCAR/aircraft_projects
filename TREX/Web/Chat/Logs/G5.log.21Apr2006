[GMT 04/21/06 13:09:41] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, hi T, so we are just up in the air now.  I am having Jim help with getting CO up and running.  We just turned on the breaker and will force a cal in a minute
[GMT 04/21/06 13:10:35] <TCampos-Seattle> Ilana, I have only my Mac this morning, so I won't be able to look at data using aeros.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:12:21] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  oh okay...I can try to relay what we see verbally then.  So this morning I reinstalled the Cal gas tank on the rack...quite surprising to notice it wasn't there about an hour before take-off so I hope I got it connected correctly

[GMT 04/21/06 13:15:13] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, you'll know if there's a problem.  Unless you purged the line, the first cal may imply that something's wrong.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:15:39] <TCampos-Seattle> So I'd ignore the first cal (unless it looks perfect, of course) :-)

[GMT 04/21/06 13:17:17] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, that sounds perfect!  Now as long as the compressor and dryer pumps are on, you are all set!
[GMT 04/21/06 13:18:10] <DaveR-Jeffco> ads-GV, John, I changed the WCN injection time this morning from 4s to 2.5s. We'll see if that forestalls its sleeping above 40kft.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:18:45] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, compressor not on yet, since it hasn't been 15 minutes yet, but dryer is on and I will double check when I can stand
[GMT 04/21/06 13:18:55] <ads-GV> Okay Dave I hope that it works.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:19:07] <wasinger-raf> just curious what is the ETA?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:19:17] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, sounds great.  Is o3 working like clockwork, as usual?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:20:03] <ads-GV> ETA where?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:20:19] <wasinger-raf> (how long is the flight?)
[GMT 04/21/06 13:20:40] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, so far I can't see anything wrong with O3, but we have some turbulence on the way up and out that is making for an interesting looking dataset
[GMT 04/21/06 13:21:11] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, cool!
[GMT 04/21/06 13:21:47] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, I hope it is not too uncomfortable.  What kind of wi are you seeing?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:22:24] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  hope so...so far CO doesn't look noisy, and concentration is about 50...what shout cal concetration be?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:23:16] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, the cal concentration is around 500-ish.  Sounds like you guys are already seeing stratospheric air.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:24:03] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  yes should in strat, at 40 kft, and O3 is above 200 ppbv
[GMT 04/21/06 13:24:29] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, CO cal was more like 900 ppb
[GMT 04/21/06 13:24:53] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, according to aeros that is
[GMT 04/21/06 13:26:26] <TCampos-Seattle> hmmm.  Ilana, it seems as though we should check one of the instrument settings.  But even if it has changed, this won't affect final data quality.  
[GMT 04/21/06 13:27:10] <TCampos-Seattle> Ilana, let's ask the person sitting in front of CO to turn on the compressor even if it is a little early.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:27:15] hvta (hvta@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &G5.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:27:39] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  also seemed like zero wasn't exactly zero in aeros, more like around 100 ppb...that's wierd...not sure what to do about that
[GMT 04/21/06 13:29:19] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, I wouldn't worry.  The aeros display is just meant to give folks a rough idea of CO levels and trends.  We hard-wire a zero and sensitivity to calculate the aeros values, and therefore, expect them to vary quite a bit over the course of a flight/mission.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:30:07] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  okay, so anyway, not noisy which is a good sign...let me get up and check the touchscreen display
[GMT 04/21/06 13:30:43] <ads-GV> wasinger-raf, The flight is scheduled for 9 hours.  ETA Jeffco about 1600 Local.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:31:22] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, ok.  To get to the cal gas concentration setting, try 'shift-f5', then 'concentration'.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:31:33] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, well things look very nice at the touchscreen, so maybe it is aeros that is just weird to me.  Otherwise, touchscreen reads 32 ppbv at 40 kft., O3 currenytly is 135 ppb
[GMT 04/21/06 13:31:51] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, sounds very fine.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:32:08] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle, still want to check concentration settings?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:32:28] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, I think things look fine. no need to check concentration.  
[GMT 04/21/06 13:33:35] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  very good then!  so as far as the abstract is concerned now...we are still waiting for Vanda's feedback.  Jorgen has instructions to wait til we hear from her.   Sounds okay?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:33:53] <TCampos-Seattle> Ilana, sounds great.  Is Vanda flying today?
[GMT 04/21/06 13:34:21] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  nope she's back at DRI now...yeah I had no idea she was leaving so soon either
[GMT 04/21/06 13:35:34] <TCampos-Seattle> Ilana, ok.  I'm going to leave in a few minutes to grab some breakfast.  I'll check back in before I head to the airport for C-130 pre-flight...  Have a good time!
[GMT 04/21/06 13:36:05] <ilana-GV> TCampos-Seattle,  yup, sounds good.  are you flying with it today?  If so have a good flight.
[GMT 04/21/06 13:37:26] <TCampos-Seattle> Ilana, nope.  Very relieved about that.  I'll be monitoring things via chat.  I'll be able to bring back the PC from the airport and try to run two versions of aeros to simultaneously look at G-V and C-130 data.  My nerdful heart gets a kick out that capability...
[GMT 04/21/06 13:37:41] <ads-GV> hvta, Please pass to Bob Beas that I fixed the seat.  It looks like it was the lock at the bottom that was in the wrong posistion.

[GMT 04/21/06 14:33:57] <TCampos-Seattle> Hi Ilana.  How are you doing?
[GMT 04/21/06 14:35:08] <ilana-GV> tyup good, so CO went a bit flatline on aeros for a while, but I think it was cause of the previous cal was still abit high...the latest cal was exactly 500 ppb, so there may still have been some air in the line when I started it up today...all looks very good now
[GMT 04/21/06 14:36:23] <TCampos-Seattle> ilana, great news.  I'm assuming the compresssor has been on for awhile, but would like confirmation to ease my worried mind.  (Sorry)
[GMT 04/21/06 14:36:50] <ilana-GV> yup compressor is on...been on since we last talked
[GMT 04/21/06 14:38:31] <TCampos-Seattle> i thought so, but wanted to hear you say it.  Well, i'm off to see the wizard--er, the c-130.  I'm sure you won't need it , but my new cell number is 425-773-3864--in case anyone peels some oranges :-)

[GMT 04/21/06 15:45:08] <ads-GV> AlCooper-G5, He incresed the water to 2.5 sec.  It has worked for the whole flight that I have seen.
[GMT 04/21/06 15:49:06] <DaveR-Jeffco> AlCooper-G5, the water injection interval was initially 8sec default.  Status light and flags showed that WCN got thirsty after ~20 min above 40kft. Then Apr13 we reduced injection time to 4s, and it made good data ~50min above 40kft. Today's results so far suggest we may have found a solution.
[GMT 04/21/06 15:50:38] <DaveR-Jeffco> AlCooper & ads-G5, you might want to glance at the WCN clear tube leading to stainless drain bottle. If we are injecting too much water, then it will drain reservoir, and you should see water in that tube.

[GMT 04/21/06 17:36:15] <ilana-GV> was meaning to ask you what highest vaue on NO monitors was that you ever saw, on both if you can remember
[GMT 04/21/06 17:36:54] <TCampos-Seattle> i can't remember at this point.  I believe it was above 2 during that one peeling episode.
[GMT 04/21/06 17:37:48] <ilana-GV> well they have been pretty flaky today.  One of them has been all over the place and the other was a slow climb up to 2

[GMT 04/21/06 18:28:51] <ads-GV> Ta 1950Z or 1350L.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:28:54] <Errol-GV> no - I last used it yesterday, it is supposed to log out after 30 minutes by itself

[GMT 04/21/06 18:38:27] <pavel_ops> Teresa, that is correct. It is 6 hrs for CO and 7 hrs for WA because of daylight savings time.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:40:26] <ads-GV> Yep Like Pavel said.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:41:24] <ads-GV> I also have secret weapon, watch ahve both local and zulu time, easy to convert. Like moose and squirrle password <grin>.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:42:48] <Errol-GV> 21 drops
[GMT 04/21/06 18:43:56] <TCampos-seattleOpsCtr> So does that mean the ADS time on the C-130 is off by an hour for today's flight???
[GMT 04/21/06 18:44:46] <TCampos-seattleOpsCtr> Pavel, sorry to be confusing.  I can't really do time zones (even in N America)
[GMT 04/21/06 18:44:48] <ads-GV> Are looking at ADS or ION?
[GMT 04/21/06 18:45:35] <ads-GV> Al said that Ion was an hour behind.  Like it did not shift.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:46:35] <TCampos-seattleOpsCtr> ION has the same problem I do I guess...
[GMT 04/21/06 18:48:20] <ads-GV> I would guess that the time on the 130 is good and that the problem is with the ion display. At 1000 MDT Al Schanot said that Ion was running 1 hour behind us.
[GMT 04/21/06 18:48:52] <ads-GV> My time was 1608 and Ion was 1508?
