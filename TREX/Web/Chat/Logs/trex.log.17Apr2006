[GMT 04/17/06 00:00:53] <Vanda-HIAPER> Jim -- the cap cloud is starting to spill over the Sierra crest north of Independence. What do the valley soundings show? 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:01:29] GSPoulos-Independence (gspoulos@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &TREX.
[GMT 04/17/06 00:04:08] <Iva-BishopOps> the only available sounding is from 20 UTC from MAPR and it shows almost adiabatic layer from around 600-700 mb. greg will ask the independece people for their sounding info now
[GMT 04/17/06 00:04:59] <Vanda-HIAPER> Iva -- Thanks. 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:05:11] <Iva-BishopOps> dlr lidar shows reversed flow relatively near to the ground on the western slopes of the sierra
[GMT 04/17/06 00:06:18] <Vanda-HIAPER> Ops Center --- What is KA currently doing? Can you see its tracks? 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:06:50] <Iva-BishopOps> no, we cant see it. no info on KA
[GMT 04/17/06 00:07:04] <Vanda-HIAPER> Ops Center --- I just heard on VHF. They are climbing up to FL220. 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:07:09] <JamesDoyle-Ops> Alex:  Can you give an update?
[GMT 04/17/06 00:08:08] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Looks like GV data is arriving on the ground
[GMT 04/17/06 00:08:18] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I see two sondes so far
[GMT 04/17/06 00:08:38] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, There should be more than that I think
[GMT 04/17/06 00:09:16] <MarkBradford-Boulder> When I first connected a few minutes ago, it didn't look like we were getting any GV data, but I may have been confused
[GMT 04/17/06 00:09:34] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Several more are arriving now
[GMT 04/17/06 00:10:11] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, First drops were over 2 hrs ago. No plots in the catalog yet.
[GMT 04/17/06 00:10:41] <MarkBradford-Boulder> GregStossmeister-ops: 11 data files on the ground now, all received in the past 4 minutes
[GMT 04/17/06 00:10:56] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I anticipate that plots will follow soon
[GMT 04/17/06 00:11:29] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Up to 15 files now, the floodgates have opened :)
[GMT 04/17/06 00:11:54] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, ok I see plots in ftp area now - for some reason they took awhile to get to us I guess.
[GMT 04/17/06 00:13:52] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, Errol was probably paying us back for that littering comment yesterday ;-)
[GMT 04/17/06 00:13:59] <MarkBradford-Boulder> heh
[GMT 04/17/06 00:14:19] <Iva-BishopOps> the upwind sounding from mglass arrived. it shows moist layer from 950  to700 mb. there is a shallow inversion at 650 mb followed by  a stable layer up to 520 mb
[GMT 04/17/06 00:14:21] <MarkBradford-Boulder> 16 files received thus far
[GMT 04/17/06 00:15:51] <MarkBradford-Boulder> afk for a while
[GMT 04/17/06 00:16:16] <GregStossmeister-ops> MarkBradford-Boulder, sorry afk?
[GMT 04/17/06 00:16:35] <Iva-BishopOps> the winds in the upwind sounding show a lot of directional shear, but at the crest level and above are WSW
[GMT 04/17/06 00:16:42] <MarkBradford-Boulder> afk == away from keyboard
[GMT 04/17/06 00:16:48] <MarkBradford-Boulder> dinnertime :)

[GMT 04/17/06 00:31:30] <areinecke-uw> thanks jim
[GMT 04/17/06 00:31:38] <Vanda-HIAPER> King Air --- We are still flying. We've just passed through the strongest wave thus far. +10, -10 m/s on the S leg at FL370 over the rotor cloud, below the wave cloud. 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:32:53] <areinecke-uw> the easter wave
[GMT 04/17/06 00:32:59] <areinecke-uw> says ron smith
[GMT 04/17/06 00:33:53] <Iva-BishopOps> on the satellite images the cloud seems to extend more along the valley (more connected)
[GMT 04/17/06 00:34:29] <areinecke-uw> thanks iva
[GMT 04/17/06 00:36:07] <Iva-BishopOps> but it is all due south of independence (i think over owens lake- my sierra geography is very bad)
[GMT 04/17/06 00:36:54] <areinecke-uw> we can see some high wave clouds south of IND, very pretty
[GMT 04/17/06 00:39:08] <areinecke-uw> ops: we are now heading east at FL190
[GMT 04/17/06 00:41:57] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> the wave cloud should be near to Lone Pine. It developed from a very thin one during the last 20 min 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:42:46] <areinecke-uw> how are the winds in the valley?
[GMT 04/17/06 00:43:05] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> there are two small cumulus below moving to the east
[GMT 04/17/06 00:43:07] <Iva-BishopOps> ISS1 shows westerlies 10 kt, while ISS2 shows northerly directions also 10 kt at the surface
[GMT 04/17/06 00:43:34] <areinecke-uw> iva:what about the profilers?
[GMT 04/17/06 00:44:40] <Vanda-HIAPER> Alex --- I am sorry but I was the first one to call this one the Easter Wave. 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:45:53] <Vanda-HIAPER> The wave cloud over Owens Lake is multi-layered. Very thin clouds but at three different levels. 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:45:56] <areinecke-uw> vanda: thats right, last tuesday i think
[GMT 04/17/06 00:46:08] <Iva-BishopOps> thats in the profilers. they only reach up to 500m agl. but iss at mapr shows westerly-south westerlies up to 1200 m agl and above that  notherly 
[GMT 04/17/06 00:47:47] <areinecke-uw> thanks iva
[GMT 04/17/06 00:48:08] <Iva-BishopOps> maximum in the mapr profiler is around 2000m agl northerly ~ 40kt. but there is also shear. some easterlies around 2000m +- 250m.
[GMT 04/17/06 00:49:11] <MarkBradford-Boulder> GregStossmeister-ops: back from dinner.  Looks like GV will be in project area until 8 PM Mountain, is that right?  Depending on timing, I might be driving home around then, but would send the sonde locations after I get back to Longmont
[GMT 04/17/06 00:49:47] <areinecke-uw> thanks iva; what is +- 250 m?

[GMT 04/17/06 00:51:05] <MarkBradford-Boulder> excellent
[GMT 04/17/06 00:53:04] <Iva-BishopOps> drl lidar also shows weak  reversed flow around 1000m and wavy motion above

[GMT 04/17/06 01:18:23] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> small cumulus unter the cap cloud are giving the impression to move around like in a rotor
[GMT 04/17/06 01:18:29] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> I have taken some photos
[GMT 04/17/06 01:19:37] <AndreasWieser_ASU-lidar> There is again a lot of dust from the owens lake south of the lidars

Lots of large-amplitude waves, but the overall picture of what exactly happened will take some time to piece together.  So, yes I think we are happy with the case, but it will take time to figure out just how this IOP fits in relative to others.
[GMT 04/17/06 02:04:46] <RogerW-GV> JimeD--Sound good.  You'll certainly have a lot of interesting dropsonde data to sort through.

[GMT 04/17/06 02:55:33] <LauraPan-home> how are you doing?
[GMT 04/17/06 02:55:51] <LauraPan-home> is 47 possible today?
[GMT 04/17/06 02:57:29] <LauraPan-home> Brian mentioned that ozone is awfully low at 45 today. It would be interesting to see if the 2000 ft see the increase of ozone
[GMT 04/17/06 02:59:11] <Vanda-HIAPER> Laura --- Doing well. Pilots are negotiating FL470 now. It is a wrong altitude for the E bound travel, so we cannot stay very long.  
[GMT 04/17/06 02:59:39] <LauraPan-home> Understand. Thanks for trying.
[GMT 04/17/06 03:00:26] <LauraPan-home> We will be looking at the large scale analyses for this persistent low ozone layer at the top of a stratospheric layer.
[GMT 04/17/06 03:00:43] <LauraPan-home> The analyses may not be able to resolved the thickness
[GMT 04/17/06 03:01:35] <LauraPan-home> if the measurements show increase during this 45 -> 47 K ascent, it will help up a lot.
[GMT 04/17/06 03:01:45] <LauraPan-home> help us, I meant.
