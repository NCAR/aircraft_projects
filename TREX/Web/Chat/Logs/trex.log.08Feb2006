[GMT 02/08/06 23:19:18] <MikeDaniels-FL> here is what i'll say, "There are many individual preferences to apply, including sound notification of messages, color highlighting and the like.  When in doubt, please consult the xchat documentation, or initiate a discussion with another chat participant."
[GMT 02/08/06 23:19:39] <BrandonSlaten-NCAR> OK.
