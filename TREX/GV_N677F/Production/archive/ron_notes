Since the T-REX project data are no longer restricted, I removed the READ
password from all GV production data files via the command:
date;  mspasswd -R -rpwd bishop -wpwd RAFDMG -newr OFF /ATD/DATA/2006/TREX/GV_N677F ; date

Wed Apr  2 21:30:10 GMT 2008

Remaining MSS bitfiles that had read passwords were in the /RAF/2006/503
path.  The script "MSS_passwd_zap" was used to reset the read password on
those bitfiles on 30 April 2008.

Discovered that HRT for RF07B1 and RF07B2 were archived with incorrect bitfile
names (2007 in file name instead of 2006).  Today I renamed the files, and now
have to change the Catalog file.  I also noticed that bitfile sizes do not
agree with the taplog files for the LRT data.  Must check out that situation.
Also would be a good idea to verify all taplog and Catalog listings to make
sure that they agree with what's actually on the MSS.

The LRT MSS bitfiles in the /ATD/DATA path have additional data merged into
them.  Therefore, I updated "taplog.503" to include information about both
types of LRT data (unaltered and Merged-Production).  I updated the web
Catalog entries (since these reflect the Production data.)
