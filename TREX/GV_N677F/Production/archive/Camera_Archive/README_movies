TREX side camera movie files

The camera is a Point Grey Research Hi-Res Flea - Color, 1024x768 resolution.
The Navitar DO-412 lens has a focal length of 4 mm.  The FOV is about 62
degrees horizontally and 48 degrees vertically with some barrel distortion. 

The camera was looking out a window ahead of the wing on the left side of
the aircraft.  It was pointing approximately perpendicular to the aircraft
longitudinal axis and slightly downward, about 8 degrees below horizontal.

Images were acquired once per second and stored as JPEG-compressed files,
roughly 50 kB each.  No processing of the images was performed beyond
converting the raw pixel signal into a 24 bit color image.  The UTC date
and time are encoded in the filename as YYMMDD-HHMMSS.jpg.  These are the
archived images stored in one-hour TAR files.

For the MPEG-4 movies each image was processed with the linux ImageMagick
toolkit.  The image was first scaled by 50% to 512 x 384 pixels.  Sharpening
and gamma adjustments were then performed [SHARPEN(0.0x1.0), GAMMA(1.3)].
Each image was then annotated on the left side of the image with the flight
data corresponding to the time derived from the image name.  The annotated
images were compiled with ffmpeg into MPEG 4 movies at 24 frames/s and 1500
kb/s data rate. 

The movies can be played by Quicktime 6.5 or later (Mac and Windows), xine
(linux), or RealPlayer 10.5 and later (Windows OK, Mac not tried).

Individual flight comments:
503RF01 - The computer clock not synced so the video lags the annotation
          data by about 30 seconds.  Some gaps in data.

503RF02 - No time sync at the beginning so video lags data by about 20
          seconds, but this is fixed at 21:48.

503RF03 - There is a 10 minute gap late in the movie due to restarting the
          computer.  Video stopped at 2400 on account of darkness.

503RF04 - Video ends at 0220 on account of darkness.

503RF05 - Images only available from 15:10 to 15:23.  The computer was
          rebooted by the user and the camera image acquisition program was
          not restarted.

503RF06 - Images from takeoff until 22:10:40 when the disk ran out of inodes,
          though only 12% full.  Two and a half hour gap from 17:00 to 19:30,
          unknown cause.
