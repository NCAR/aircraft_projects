Ron, I heard in the wind that the GV TREX data location will change to 
a password protected area. Please let me know if that has happen. I 
will continue to go to the old link for data before hearing from you. 
Thanks. -Laura

Ron, I am a bit confused what rf08 was. Was it a test flight led by 
Jorgen? Thanks. -Laura

    Ron, I checked, here is what the TREX facility request form said,
    however, I am not aware that this request was submitted to Carbone. 

Brigitte


    Do you intend to request restricted access?

Yes. We plan to request exclusive access to the T-REX data for the first 
year.

Ron, 

I have forwarded this to Jorgen for his "ruling" regarding T-REX, but it
was my understanding that T-REX wanted restricted access for the first
year (although I don't know if they ever made this request formally to
EOL). You should check with Jorgen before acting on this.

I see no reason to restrict access to the test-flight data, with
appropriate warnings that this dataset is *very* preliminary, coming
from the first test flights of the aircraft. It is probably not very
useful for anything except our own purposes, unless he is just
interested in learning how to use the formats in preparation for future
uses of G-V data. Please allow Dick and Allen/Jeff/Jorgen to comment,
though, before proceeding.

  -- Al

________________________________________________________________

Follow-up message from Ron Ruth:

Dick & Al,

It turns out that this person also requested access to the T-REX data on
the CDP.  It may be that Georg applied for the HIAPER data set by
mistake
(or not) and was mainly interested in T-REX.  In any case, I still need
to reply to the request.

Everyone:

I don't see any reason to release preliminary data from any of the GV 
flights to someone outside of the basic science participants.  I'm not 
sure we should ever release the original "test" data.  What is this 
person's justification for access?  We work very hard to avoid 
distributing "preliminary" data for the obvious reasons.  Tell him no.

Allen

Hi Michael. After several attempts, I am unable to duplicate the  
problem. Ron, can you try again and keep track of your steps in case  
you see the blank page again?

Ron, et. al.:

As Cooper points out the data from the first early test flights are very 
preliminary and don't contain much information other than the basic 
state parameter measurements. There were some temperature probe and data 
system issues that also compromised the data. If we release the data for 
the test flights to the requestor,  we should make it abundantly clear 
the nature of the data. Also, I do not know at this time if we have any 
intention of doing a final or "production" run on the test program data. 
It is primarily for internal check out and use.

Releasing these data may cause more of a burden on us answering 
questions than being of any value to the requestor. These are my 
comments. For the reasons above I don't think we should release these 
data unless the requestor wants to give an explanation of how they 
intend to use it. There is a possibility that this is not the data set 
they are really after.

Jorgen is the point of contact on this issue.  Keep me informed if any

I guess I was confused--I thought this was a request for T-Rex data.   
Data from test flights that are not part of the project would seem to be 
outside of what should be released unless there are specific items in 
the data that justify releasing it.   We get in trouble releasing data 
that are not well understood.

Hi all,

Yes, Vanda has requested the 1-year exclusive period, and she should 
approve/dissapprove the data access for T-REX.

With regard to progressive science, nobody to my knowledge requested 
exclusive access. But the data is still only the prelimenary data set, 
and I think that we should 'not' release it to other non-PIs until the 
final data set is available, hopefully in mid June.

Cheers, Jorgen

Hi Ron,

removed the "HIAPER" test dataset  and all supporting infrastructure

I can't find rday10 or any variant of rday.   ruth or Ron don't exist  
except in your regular  UCAS login

Did I get the login name wrong?


Thanks,

Michael

I'm sending this to mail.ucar.edu   If you get it, you can use this:  
ruth@mail.eol.ucar.edu and we can skip trying to figure this out --  
Oh BTW I just looked at the login page on dev and it's not working.   
That's why we call it dev :)  I'll let you know when Luca fixes it.

Jorgen,

I would expect it would be easy to set up a password-accessed ftp
directory, and I'd be willing to send in an EOL help request to do that.

However, I don't recall that anyone from T-REX officially requested that
this project's data be restricted.  That request, according to our Data
Policy, needs to be in place before the project begins.  (I'll check with
Brigitte.)  [This is really a side-light and really has no bearing on the
current topic which deals with preliminary data.  Ron]

By the same token, there is no onus on EOL to make the preliminary data
available to the public via the ftp site.  (Public access just defaulted
that way.)  I set up the ftp directory via a request, and I created it
and the web link to it to make it easy for the PIs to get the files.
If it is not possible to password-protect the ftp directory, we can delete
it (as well as its link, if necessary) and then possibly set up some other
method for them to get our preliminary data.  That way files won't be
available to the masses via a few simple mouse clicks as it is now.

(I'm sure there are ftp log files that can tell us who has downloaded
the data if we want to research that, but it may take a lot of digging.)

Jorgen,

I was thinking about the password protection and realized it will work
only with the web-based browser access to the ftp directory.  If people
use the standard command-line ftp commands, the file system still will
be available.  So, if we really want limited access, then we'll have to
figure out some other way for them to access the data.  I guess I'll
query the system admin staff to see what they recommend.

Santiago,

Makes perfect sense.  I really was wondering whether this was possible.

I'm presently working with Michael Burek to move these data to the SCD
Community Data Portal.  It should be ready tomorrow, so you may close
this request.

Vanda,

I am setting up an SCD Community Data Portal location for restricted access
to the T-REX GV preliminary data including both the netCDF and camera movie
files.  In a README file within the present ftp site, I made a note that
this will be taking place soon.  It asks that anyone who needs access to
the data after the files have been moved to contact you at the above email
address.

Before the move actually happens, I'll have login/password information for
you, or you can instead forward requests to me, and I'll set up logins to
those people you approve.

I hope this is OK with you.  (Please let me know ASAP if not.)  The portal
should be set up probably some time tomorrow.  After it is ready, I'll check
to make sure that data can really be accessed that way.  I'll then notify
you and delete all the files (except the README file) from the ftp site.
Of course, all future data will be posted at the new location.

P.S.  The URL for the Community Data Portal is:  https://cdp.ucar.edu/

Ron

Vanda,

I cannot speak for the speed of the data transfers on the CDP.  I can
gzip the files to make them a bit smaller (netCDF, not movie); this will
help shorten the transfer somewhat, but users will have to gunzip them
after transmission.

The CDP has a registry mechanism for restricted data sets.  Basically,
a new user will pull up the CDP web site for T-REX and register to join
the group via a short questionnaire.  This process will send an email
message to the administrator(s) of the data set.  Any administrator can
approve membership after which the user receives an email message in reply
and can then download from the catalog.  (Users need register only once.)

When the site is ready, I'll be sure to make you an administrator; then you
can approve/disapprove each new user (unless you want me to forward each
request to you for approval after which I'll approve/disapprove it).  If
you do want to handle the approval process (will be less delay to each
user), I'll walk you through the web pages to show you how it's done.
It's not very hard.

I'll keep you posted on the portal's progress.  It is still in the setup
stage at this moment, even though all the preliminary data through RF07
has been posted there.

Vanda,

Sorry I forgot to answer one question from your last message about where
our production (quality checked) data set will be posted.  Normally the
data from our projects are avalailable via the RAF web site and via the
EOL Data Retrieval web pages:
      http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Projects/
      http://www.atd.ucar.edu/rdp/mss_retrieval/
However, these data also can be published on the Community Data Portal:
      https://cdp.ucar.edu/
If you desire to have all data products from T-REX available in one place,
then the CDP is a logical place to publish them.  To be most useful there,
it is important to generate an organized and well-thought-out set of
metadata to describe the project and each available product.  We can work
on this after the field phase is over while we are preparing the final
data sets.

Michael,

I just had a chance to try out the URL listed below.  The "home" page
came up, but when I clicked on the "login" button on top, and later
when I tried again and clicked on the restricted HIAPER data set,
instead of getting a login window, I got a blank page.  (Looking at
the page source, it truly was blank.)

Al,

Vanda Grubisic is handling all the T-REX requests.  I only mentioned it,
because he requested both data sets, and I thought the HIAPER one may
have been by mistake.  I will wait for other comments.

Rob,

I tried it again, and it seems to be working fine for me now, too.
One thing that may have affected the previous operation is that I
had 3 separate tabs all pointing to the CDP.  Somehow they may have
gotten in each others' way.

To all,

My recollection is that after the first set of test flights on the GV 
occurred, SCD wanted a demo data set on the Community Data Portal (CDP)
from EOL, the first HIAPER was then "published" for that purpose.  Since
it now has no reason to exist there, I have requested that it be deleted
from the CDP.

I'm reasonably sure that each of the two requests for this data set came
as a result of publicizing the availability of the T-REX preliminary GV
data.  Visitors to the CDP probably mistook this test entry from T-REX.
Neither of them has been granted access.

Michael,

I can try it again.  The login's email address (rday10@earthlink.net)
is what caused the new login to be rejected not the login name itself.
I actually don't remember what login name I used (could have been "ron"
or "ron_test" or some other spontaneously made-up name).

Thanks.  I did receive this, so I'll use that email address next time.

Rod,

No new data are available for T-REX.  At the request of PI Vanda Grubisic
the preliminary data were moved to a restricted-access area.  You an get
information regarding the new location from our T-REX web site:
      http://www.eol.ucar.edu/raf/Projects/TREX/
The first bulleted item has a link for the CDP and another for registration
instructions.

I'm sorry to report that there are no high-rate data yet available in any
form.

You can check with Project Manager Jorgen Jensen <jbj@ucar.edu>,
(303)497-1028 about when you can expect any new data.  He's presently
out of the office until Wednesday (3rd).

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.

Ron

Hi Ron,

The T-REX PIs have requested password protection on the HIAPER data that 
we have on the web. Can that be done? Thanks.

Also, they requested propritary access to the data after the experiment, 
so they are obviously interested in limiting access.

Cheers, jorgen

Jeff,

I have just approved your access to the T-REX CDP area. The video  
camera on G5 was side looking.

Vanda,
Geoffrey Haines-Stiles, who is doing the video from TREX,  wants me to 
put together some 3D movies from a couple of the IOPs.
Can I get access to the TREX CDP area? We're a little tight on time and 
I am trying to get him some rough cuts early next week.

Michael - is there nose cone camera imagery available from the TREX G5 
flights like there was for RICO?
It would be really cool to show those in the IDV as well.

Thanks,
Jeff

What data is there? We need the G5 and the Wyoming King-Air track files, 
the dropsondes
and the satellite imagery.

I really need the actual data, not the imagery in the catalog. Chris 
Burghart for me a tar of the
raw data files.

Ron,

I have some lidar datasets of about 60GB, and I'm thinking of putting them on the CDP in 
the T-REX section until we come up with a better solution. I could put them into CODIAC, 
since it can read data from the MSS, but those files can't have an MSS read password on 
them to be read by CODIAC. So, even though they would be T-REX password-protected data, 
they wouldn't be completely protected. Anyone on the Mass Store could conceivably read 
them. We probably will make changes in CODIAC for this, but in the meantime I would like 
to make the data available, but also completely password protected. It is my understanding 
that the CDP uses a read password on the MSS files it accesses. So, I was wondering what 
steps do I need to take to put data to the CDP?

thanks,
Don

Ron,

Thanks for the contact info. I sent Michael B. an email and we can see 
what he says.

Michael,

I have two LIDAR data sets at the present. They are a bit over your web 
upload size. One is 25GB and the other is 45GB. Will data sets of this 
size go on your server, or do they go on the Mass Store?

Ron said he thought maybe I should add myself to the EOL administrator's 
list on the CDP, but I would rather not be bothered with granting 
access, etc, and prefer leaving all that to Vanda.

Thanks for the information. Once I get the go-ahead to copy the data and 
supply whatever metadata information is necessary, am I correct in 
thinking that these files will then be automatically password protected, 
since they will be part of the larger T-REX collection of data?

I think we can house them on the disk to begin with, then look at the  
download stats.  If the downloads are infrequent we can remove them  
from disk and have them served only from the MSS.  In any case, we  
strongly urge you keep a backup mirror of these data on the MSS.  We  
are currently bringing a restore function online that will restore  
datasets to the disk from MSS in the event of a disk failure.  This  
mechanism requires a mirror on the MSS of what is on disk.

That's fine.  If you're an admin you will see the email traffic that  
of who is applying for access, and when Vanda grants or denies  
access. You can also look at who is in the group, and get signed up  
for automatic download stats emails *if* you want to see them.

Yes, automatically protected for access only by T-REX group members  
(and CDP developers over here, of course).

I'll need to create an account for you on a machine called dataportal  
to allow you to upload via sftp.  Dataportal uses OTP so you need a  
cryptocard to gain access.   Let me know when I should proceed with  
getting you an account.

Michael,

I have the crytocard, so will be ready to go ahead at any time. I will be uploading T-REX 
data in my capacity of making available on the web all data sets related to the T-REX 
project, as well as overseeing the composite formation of the surface data. I am in the 
NCAR/EOL Data Management Group (DMG).

Don,

I'll have to get back to you on this Monday.  In short, I really don't
know the answer to your question.  I suggest you contact Michael Burek
<mburek@ucar.edu>, ext. 1202.  It's OK with me if you add yourself to
the EOL administrator's list on the CDP.

(I'm hoping to attend Ramanathan's seminar today.)

Ron,

I received several CDP registration requests overnight. I am  
currently going through them and giving them "read" permissions. Only  
one came as a double request. I assume this was (inadvertently) done  
by the requestor (who also
for fun or by mistake wrongly specified the country), but do, please,  
continue to watch for that type of feature.

Thanks for your help,
Vanda

Vanda,

I assume that you have been receiving CDP registration requests also.
(If not, please contact me ASAP.)  Since you are the person who will
be accepting/rejecting them, I plan *NOT* to act on any of them.
(I see that you have already approved some of them.)  I also noticed
that, for some reason, a few are coming in pairs. This may have been
done by the requestor, but if I see it keep on happening, I'll contact
the CDP administrator to see if there is a bug in the requesting process.

If you have any questions or need anything from me, please feel free
to write or call.

Ron

Luca,

Actually, Vanda Grubisic <grubisic@dri.edu, phone: (775)674-7031>
is handling all access to the preliminary T-REX data.  I'm out of
the loop.

P.S.  Vanda has usually responded to these requests promptly.

Jeff,

There was a camera pointed out a window on the left side of the GV,
but there was no forward-looking one.

Only the preliminary flight-level netCDF files are available on the
T_REX CDP site.  Due to their preliminary nature, Vanda, the project's
Principal Investigator, must approve all access.

Ron

Jeff,

Some of what you want can be found on the EOL T-REX Field Catalog, URL:
      http://catalog.eol.ucar.edu/trex/

In the Research Products, URL:
      http://catalog.eol.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/trex/research/index
you can get the aircraft flight tracks.

In the Operational Products, URL:
      http://catalog.eol.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/trex/ops/index
are satellite images (GOES-10, MODIS).

The dropsonde data should be ready early next week.

All available raw (preliminary) JPG images from the GV's left side camera
have been archived to the SCD Mass Store system in a group of tar files
(one hour duration each).  No movie files have been produced yet.

I tried calling Vanda, but her voice mail indicated that she was out
of town and best contacted via email.  (Of course, your CDP request was
emailed to her, so she must really be incognito.)

Ron,

I think this is fine. However, will the preliminary data continue to  
be available upon request? I presume you continue to keep it in your  
archives.

Michael,

As it turns out, the only copy of the preliminary GV flight-level data
that I know exists is on the CDP.  Therefore, before you actually purge
the files from dataportal, I'd like to get a copy of them.  I just logged
in and got the following listing:

What is the best way to get them?  Is ftp enabled in a way that I can
download them myself?  Is msrcp enabled so I can copy them directly to
the Mass Store (from dataportal)?

Thanks for the help.

Ron

Hi Ron,

If you're logged in to a shell session I think you should be able to  
copy to the MSS directly using standard MSS commands.  Your login  
account will be charged for the MSS usage, so if you need to use  
another account you'll have to use the appropriate commands to set  
that up before you begin to copy.

  sftp also works, if you want to go that way.

Glad I was slow to get to this :-)  Lemme know when I should proceed  
with removing these data.

Michael

Jorgen,

As of now the preliminary data files exist only on the CDP.  Access to them
has now been removed, but I can archive the files and make them available
by request.  (Normally we do not archive preliminary netCDF files.)  Do you
think there is a justification for doing this?  I wanted to ask you about
it before replying to Vanda.

P.S.  As of today, the promised link to the production data is not showing
       up on the Data Portal.  All one gets is a totally-blank page.  I'll
       get together with Michael Burek to fix that.

Hi Ron,

many thanks. I think that only the production data set should be  
available; I thought that it was available much earlier? maybe I  
misunderstand; is it simply that the production data set has been  
moved, and that the new location is non-functioning at present?

Cheers, Jorgen

Jorgen,

In late April last year I set up restricted access to the preliminary
T-REX flight-level data from the G-V.  I copied the preliminary data
from our anonymous ftp site to the Community Data Portal (CDP) and added 
restricted access there.  I then removed the files from our ftp site.
Later they aged off local Jeffco file systems, so the only extant copies
were on the CDP.

When you released the production LRT data set, I archived the data files
to the SCD Mass Store System (MSS) with a read password and submitted the
catalog to the EOL CDS Data Management Group.  Their web site is now the
location for obtaining the production LRT flight-level data:
      http://data.eol.ucar.edu/master_list/?project=T-REX

Last week, I thought it best to remove the preliminary data from the CDP.
I couldn't figure out how to do that myself, so I wrote Michael Burek, and
he zeroed out the T-REX page on the CDP.  (If you click on the T-REX link,
it gives the user a blank page.)  He also had plans to remove the data
files but had not done that by yesterday afternoon.  (I had asked him to
replace the web page with a link to our EOL T-REX data management web site
where people could request the production data (See link above.), but, as
of yesterday, that hadn't happened.)  I also wrote Vanda to let her know
this.

Over the weekend, Vanda replied asking us to continue making the
preliminary data available on a "request" basis and to keep the files in
our archive.  Yesterday I again contacted Michael and asked him to hold
off destroying the preliminary files on the CDP until we decided what to
do.  I'd like to know why Vanda still wants access to the preliminary data.

Our unwritten (but ongoing) policy has been to zap all preliminary data
after the release of a production data set, and I continue to feel that
way.  (I'm sure we can get the list of users who have requested preliminary
data from the CDP.  Ideally, we should write to them asking them to destroy
their copies and replacing them with the production versions.)

So, that's where we stand right now.  I'll leave it up to you and Vanda
to decide what to do about the preliminary data.  For now it will stay
on the CDP discs.  If you and Vanda decided to keep them, I'll archive
them in a special MSS directory with read protection awaiting any potential
"special requests."  If you decide to zap them (my recommendation), I'll
ask Michael to remove and destroy the CDP copies.

Please keep me informed.

Ron

Don,

I gave Michael Burek instructions to delete all the preliminary GV netCDF
data from the Community Data Portal.  Files are on the machine
dataportal.ucar.edu in the directory /datazone/CDP1/eol/trex/.

You own a "lidar" directory in that path that seems to be empty.
(I didn't look for hidden files.)  Do you need it?  If not, I can have
Michael delete the entire "trex" subdirectory, since I don't need it
any more.

Please let me know.

Thanks.

Ron

I see by the ownership that I would only have been able to remove 3 of
them.

Don Stott apparently created the empty "lidar" directory, and I have
sent him an email asking him if he needs it.  I should get word from
him before one zaps that directory.  Also, I was going to put a redirect
web page (would have a link to the currently-available T-REX data that
a visitor could mouse-click) on the CDP where now there is only a blank
page, but I didn't know how to do that.

The alternative would be to entirely remove any reference to T-REX from
the CDP altogether, but to keep from getting the wrath of users, I'd like
to let them all know that the data-access location has changed.

I'll get back to you once I hear from Don.  Let me know if you have any
other questions or unresolved issues.

Thanks for doing this.

Ron

Ron,

That's correct. I made that directory in anticipation of putting some 
lidar data there. We updated CODIAC instead, and never needed it, after 
all. It may be deleted.

Hi Ron,

I zapped the files and the lidar directories, and republished the  
dataset.  If the dirs are needed it's about 10 sec of work to put  
them back.

I added a line to the bottom of the summary to alert users that they  
should follow the link to get to the current data.

If you tell me what the new URL is I'll get it in there.

Michael

I added http://www.eol.ucar.edu/projects/trex/ as the external
