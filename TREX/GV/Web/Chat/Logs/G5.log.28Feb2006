[GMT 02/28/06 19:18:57] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Also, I notice that on syrah, your currently running ACtracker cmd line has "hallertau.atd.ucar.edu:33521", but doesn't have the "-r" before it.  Don't forget the "-r"s! :-)

[GMT 02/28/06 20:01:56] <ChrisWebster-GV> DaveR-Jeffco how do things look?
[GMT 02/28/06 20:02:13] <JanetScannell-Veracruz> Things get sent to the ground every 15 seconds.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:02:28] <ChrisWebster-GV> ChrisBurghart-Bishop Ground LDM only checks every 30 seconds, regardless of what I'm doing.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:03:08] <DaveR-Jeffco> Chris- well, chat and Google tracks are working. I'm in the 1pm TREX planning meeting now. 
[GMT 02/28/06 20:03:24] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> OK, that explains why I'm not seeing frequent updates in our track here.  But we *are* getting a track here!  :-)
[GMT 02/28/06 20:03:25] <ChrisWebster-GV> Thanks Dave.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:03:46] <JanetScannell-Veracruz> The 30 second ldm checks are when the ldm can't connect to a specific host.  Data should show up at 15 second intervals.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:04:43] <ChrisWebster-GV> Well I asked Unidata this question, and the they said unless nimbus is in the same process group as ldm then it's only every 30 seconds.  I also verified this on the ground last week.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:05:49] <ChrisWebster-GV> So I need to figure out how to put a process in a process group....

[GMT 02/28/06 20:13:42] <DaveR-Jeffco> Chris- latest data on rt-ground (orion.atd.ucar.edu) is ~30 minutes old (19:58z). However, google plot is current for both track and data.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:14:17] <JanetScannell-Veracruz> DaveR - You need to use sloop for GV data.  orion is for C130 data.

[GMT 02/28/06 20:41:50] <ChrisWebster-GV> Anyone know how to connect to a samba server from an XP client?
[GMT 02/28/06 20:42:06] <ChrisWebster-GV> I configured the linux server as a samba server, serving out a directory.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:42:33] <ChrisWebster-GV> We are now on the AVAPS machine, we can see hyper samba under MyGroups,
[GMT 02/28/06 20:42:56] <ChrisWebster-GV> it then pops up a dialog asking user name & password, the ads username password fail....
[GMT 02/28/06 20:43:25] <MarkBradford-Bishop> The classic mismatch there is whether password encryption is turned on in the Samba config file
[GMT 02/28/06 20:43:52] <ChrisWebster-GV> Thanks let me check.  Do I check both computers?
[GMT 02/28/06 20:44:11] <MarkBradford-Bishop> The XP machine will be trying to use encryption, so make sure the Samba server has it turned on
[GMT 02/28/06 20:44:28] <MarkBradford-Bishop> That's not the only possible problem but it's always the first one I check
[GMT 02/28/06 20:45:27] <DaveR-Jeffco> Greg- can you confirm that the King hot-wire is power on? 
[GMT 02/28/06 20:47:22] <ChrisWebster-GV> Server has encryption on.  Do I need a 'samba user' on the server?
[GMT 02/28/06 20:48:14] <MarkBradford-Bishop> Probably -- it's been a little while since I've configured samba
[GMT 02/28/06 20:48:30] <ChrisWebster-GV> 10-4.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:49:03] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I'll glance over the last samba config I did, it happens to be handy
[GMT 02/28/06 20:51:16] <ads-G5> We're in.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:51:23] <ads-G5> samba that is...
[GMT 02/28/06 20:51:26] <MarkBradford-Bishop> cool
[GMT 02/28/06 20:53:38] <ads-G5> Dropsonde D files heading to the ground.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:53:56] <ChrisWebster-GV> Yes Dave this is Greg and the PLWC is on and seems to be working.  How well I am not really sure
[GMT 02/28/06 20:54:20] <ads-G5> No, wait I guess we need it in the ground ldm file. hold on.
[GMT 02/28/06 20:54:55] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Greg, what are we calling the Left Temp probe now?  TTL???
[GMT 02/28/06 20:55:41] <ads-G5> Anyone have problem with me restarting the ldm on malbec?
