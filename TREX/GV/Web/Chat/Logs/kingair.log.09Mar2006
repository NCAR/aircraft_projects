[GMT 03/09/06 17:44:45] <BrianBillings-bishop> Here's an update from the pre-flight briefing for HIAPER. They plan to alter their ferry flight to pass through the feature in the RUC forecast, which I called a tropopause fold. However, there was a debate between HIAPER and ACD regarding the true nature of this feature. We'll monitor the HIAPER track to see what they'll do. 
[GMT 03/09/06 17:45:28] <glover1-N2UW> Do you have any upstream data?
