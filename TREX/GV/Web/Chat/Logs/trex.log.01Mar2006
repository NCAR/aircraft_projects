[GMT 03/01/06 17:58:34] <MarkBradford-Bishop> No, he's across the room from me here in Bishop
[GMT 03/01/06 17:58:55] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> See http://generic.networklinux.net/chris_trex.jpg for a picture of me this morning...
[GMT 03/01/06 18:00:33] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Chris, I have a question for you, but it will be a sec while I get details...
[GMT 03/01/06 18:01:01] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> nice.  http://www.wildsnow.com and goto 2nd article down to see me.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:01:06] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> ok
[GMT 03/01/06 18:02:15] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> I'm on the GV on and off my laptop.  will be out 12:00-1:30 mst.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:03:42] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Chris, did you tweak LDM's pqact.conf on malbec yesterday?  LDM stopped yesterday afternoon, and
[GMT 03/01/06 18:03:56] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> the line causing problems is related to GV data.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:04:03] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> yes
[GMT 03/01/06 18:04:31] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> I added a line for the dropsonde D files.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:04:46] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> I was just getting around to look at it now.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:04:50] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> The magic character in pqact.conf is <tab>.  It has to be there before and after FILE, and before the name of the file being written.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:05:05] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I've fixed things, and LDM is running again.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:05:15] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> oh.  how 1980's of it.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:05:31] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> That got a good laugh here in ops.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:06:02] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Are the D20 files the dropsonde D files?
[GMT 03/01/06 18:06:08] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> yes.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:06:27] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> When did you restart?  I just edited ldmd.conf to change gv to hyper.guest.ucar.edu
[GMT 03/01/06 18:06:51] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I restarted roughly 15 minutes ago.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:07:03] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> Ok, we need it again.  You or me?
[GMT 03/01/06 18:07:19] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Go ahead.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:11:51] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> done.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:12:42] Nick change: snorman -> snorman-fl
[GMT 03/01/06 18:15:03] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> can someone refresh my memory, should pqexpire be run on the source or destination end of things?
[GMT 03/01/06 18:15:17] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Source
[GMT 03/01/06 18:15:55] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> (I'm assuming you want to avoid sending old images to the GV when it first starts up its LDM)
[GMT 03/01/06 18:16:20] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> Expire stuff on the plane that is headed for the ground....
[GMT 03/01/06 18:20:47] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> OK.  Source side in either case.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:21:44] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> snorman-fl: Susan, I got your question about IDV images.  We aren't generating any images at all right now, but my guess is that we will be making them every 15 minutes.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:24:22] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Chris, is it OK if I write the D files from the GV to a different directory, so they aren't mixed in with all those SQL files?
[GMT 03/01/06 18:25:02] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> Yes.  I'm not interested in anything but getting them to the ground for you.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:28:54] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> cb did you restart ldm yet?  For some reason only the last of the 4 files is making it the ground.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:29:38] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Didn't you restart it (see your message above at 11:19:36)?
[GMT 03/01/06 18:30:45] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I just saw four nimbus_sql products come in, looking via "ldmadmin watch"
[GMT 03/01/06 18:31:29] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> Ok, let me resend the D files.  Yes I restarted ldm, maybe it doesn't need to be restarted for pqacct.conf changes....
[GMT 03/01/06 18:32:27] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I'm pretty sure it *does* need to be restarted for pqact.conf changes.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:33:29] <MarkBradford-Bishop> I always restart the whole mess on general principles, since it only takes a few seconds.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:33:50] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> ok, I see you didn't change it for the new D file destination....
[GMT 03/01/06 18:35:51] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> done & restarted.
[GMT 03/01/06 18:37:18] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Nope.  I'm getting stuff set up for the conversion to netCDF as well.  New dest dir isn't critical, but I wanted to check so I didn't change it out from under you (if something else was looking for the D files in the current dest dir)
[GMT 03/01/06 18:38:53] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> ok no new D files are showing up on the ground.  Log file reads:
[GMT 03/01/06 18:38:55] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> INFO: hereis: duplicate:   216781 20060301184421.006     EXP 000  D20060228_202643_P.1
[GMT 03/01/06 18:39:10] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> Are you sure about the pqexpire thing?
[GMT 03/01/06 18:39:36] <ChrisWebster-SlickRockCafe> I used: pqexpire -a 0.0001 -i 0 -p "D20"
