[GMT 03/13/06 19:53:41] <MarkBradford-Boulder> I think it's officially &MILAGRO -- that's the one that's being logged
[GMT 03/13/06 19:56:22] <truss-veracruz> is there a tech channel as at RICO?
[GMT 03/13/06 19:56:28] <truss-veracruz> off the main?
[GMT 03/13/06 19:56:46] <MarkBradford-Boulder> You can create one at will -- any channel you /join will be created if it doesn't exist
[GMT 03/13/06 19:57:03] <truss-veracruz> nothing yet though? for trex or milagro?
[GMT 03/13/06 19:57:07] <MarkBradford-Boulder> One isn't being officially monitored or logged because there's no real need for an official log of that stuff
[GMT 03/13/06 19:57:23] <MarkBradford-Boulder> It's existed at times for T-REX
[GMT 03/13/06 19:57:34] <truss-veracruz> ok
[GMT 03/13/06 20:00:54] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Away for a while
