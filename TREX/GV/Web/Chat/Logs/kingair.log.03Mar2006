[GMT 03/03/06 00:02:50] <grubisic-laptop> Where are you going next?
[GMT 03/03/06 00:04:55] <perrywechsler-n2uw> We will continue the stack. It is disipating, but Larrya feels that 'we got it'.

[GMT 03/03/06 00:20:30] <MarkBradford-Bishop> She's looking into it, Perry
[GMT 03/03/06 00:23:28] <VandaGrubisic-Bishop> The returns from the Onion Valley Rd profiler are improving---reach from the ground to 4 km AGL. That would speak of moisture increase. Vertical velocity and spectral width are increasing, too. 
[GMT 03/03/06 00:26:03] <perrywechsler-n2uw> Thanks. We are on a 7000ft leg, light to moderate turbulence.
[GMT 03/03/06 00:27:00] <VandaGrubisic-Bishop> Profiler at Manzanar is now also showing downward motion at 3 km AGL. Surface winds at that site are still out of 140, but wind speed has gone up to ~11 m/s (form 6 m/s) suddenly around 22 UTC.
[GMT 03/03/06 00:28:27] <perrywechsler-n2uw> We concur. On the 6000 ft leg we are seeing 8m/s, 200true.
[GMT 03/03/06 00:29:05] <perrywechsler-n2uw> 6000 ft leg is 2000 AGL

[GMT 03/03/06 00:41:29] <perrywechsler-n2uw> Thanks Vanda. We will complete this stack, we will head back to the original line.

[GMT 03/03/06 01:35:45] <VandaGrubisic-Bishop> Will we be able to use radar data from the rotor cloud for the dual Doppler analysis? 
[GMT 03/03/06 01:36:24] <VandaGrubisic-Bishop> Were returns strong enough for that? 
[GMT 03/03/06 01:36:36] <perrywechsler-n2uw> It was marginal. We will have to wait to see it on the ground.
