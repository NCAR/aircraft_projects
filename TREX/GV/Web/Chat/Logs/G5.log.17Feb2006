[GMT 02/17/06 00:25:51] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Jorgen, Is the tdl working?  (pp2f_lhs and pp2f_lhl should be giving a few thousand counts.)
[GMT 02/17/06 00:27:21] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Chris, should the Google Earth track plot work for this flight?
[GMT 02/17/06 00:30:01] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> G5, how are things going up there?

[GMT 02/17/06 00:33:43] <DaveR-G5> WCN worked okay until high altitude, then flow control problems.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:34:03] <ChrisWebster-G5> There is no transmission to ground at this time.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:34:12] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Thanks, Chris.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:34:53] <laptop4-g5> droping to 14K to do a speed run
[GMT 02/17/06 00:34:54] <laptop4-g5> that was 24K
[GMT 02/17/06 00:35:26] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Would someone mind chatting down the values that pp2f_lhs and pp2f_lhl are reading?  Thx.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:37:43] Nick change: laptop4-g5 -> jc2-GV
[GMT 02/17/06 00:38:47] <DaveR-G5> Installed new version of aeros-3289 on dropsonde computer. Aeros-3289 works okay for track plot and xy, but crashes if time series. 
[GMT 02/17/06 00:40:09] <ads-G5> ETA is appro6:15
[GMT 02/17/06 00:43:40] <DaveR-G5> Also should mention that this is aeros-3289 on WinXP. 
[GMT 02/17/06 00:44:32] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- pp2f_lhl is 3 to 7, and pp2f_lhs is 9 to 15.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:45:02] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- present altitude 26kft.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:47:58] <jc2-GV> dropping out of 26K for 13K.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:48:02] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Has the instrument been turned on?  Those two variables should read > 10^2 and more like a few 10^3.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:50:57] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- looks like it is powered OFF.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:51:29] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Dave, would you mind switching on the instrument?  All you need to do is flip the large toggle switch.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:52:50] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- I see a line of cct breakers, MAIN +6 others. Which ones go on?
[GMT 02/17/06 00:54:43] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Dave, the TDL is in the forward-most rack and is the only instrument installed there.  The front panel only has one switch.  
[GMT 02/17/06 00:55:41] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- oh! I thought we were talking the CO rack.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:56:14] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- Greg just checked TDL in front rack. It is ON and has been on most of flight.
[GMT 02/17/06 00:56:56] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Dave, thanks.  That's a relief.  Are pp2f_lhs and pp2f_lhl still reading count rates less than 20?
[GMT 02/17/06 00:57:28] <jc2-GV> eta now 20 min.

[GMT 02/17/06 01:02:14] <jc2-GV> Ron,  Are all chat channels, even new ones we make on the fly logged?
[GMT 02/17/06 01:02:16] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- pp2f values same as before. Lots of variance +/- 3, occasional spikes >1000. 
[GMT 02/17/06 01:02:36] <RonRuth-BJC> I'm not sure.  Joe Vinson would know.
[GMT 02/17/06 01:03:17] <jc2-GV> Okay I'll ask him.  Thanks
[GMT 02/17/06 01:04:44] <TeresaCampos-Jeffco> Dave, my fear is that the fiber optics have been damaged.  I'll look into that tomorrow I guess.
[GMT 02/17/06 01:06:03] <DaveR-G5> Teresa- best we can do for now. I'm moving back to aerosol rack seat. ciao for now.
