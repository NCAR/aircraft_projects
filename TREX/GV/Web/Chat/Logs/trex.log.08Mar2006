[GMT 03/08/06 17:20:33] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Morning Mark.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:20:45] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Morning, Brandon!
[GMT 03/08/06 17:21:10] <MarkBradford-Boulder> It's raining and snowing out here, how's Bishop?
[GMT 03/08/06 17:21:47] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> The Wireless AP went down again overnight.  Could not connect even through the wired LAN.  No logs to speak of either, are available from the interface.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:21:56] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Sunny, Windy, Cold.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:22:32] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Yeah, I saw the same thing Sunday evening.  I don't know what its deal is; I suppose we could look for updated firmware.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:23:13] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> I will check.

[GMT 03/08/06 17:28:36] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Yes,  He got 6 sondes yesterday.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:29:18] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Jim Moore told me that.  Impressive!
[GMT 03/08/06 17:29:51] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> I will have him get on chat so you can talk to him.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:30:24] ChrisBurghart-Bishop (burghart@rdcc.guest.ucar.edu) joined &TREX.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:30:38] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Hi Mark
[GMT 03/08/06 17:31:16] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Hi, Chris -- did you get my e-mail?
[GMT 03/08/06 17:36:31] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I did.  Aspen is already being invoked to make netCDF files, so making the CLASS files should be easy.  Copying to ftp space might be trickier, since malbec has limited mounts.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:37:44] <MarkBradford-Boulder> We can just invoke FTP from within a Perl script or something to stuff the files into the FTP space
[GMT 03/08/06 17:38:05] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Just got your mail with the sonde photos, very cool
[GMT 03/08/06 17:38:38] <MarkBradford-Boulder> The three you got from the march 2 flight, was that the little cluster north of the ISFF tower?
[GMT 03/08/06 17:39:16] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Kind of weird to use ftp to move files from malbec to another local machine, but if it works...
[GMT 03/08/06 17:40:31] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Does malbec have Net::FTP installed?
[GMT 03/08/06 17:40:46] <MarkBradford-Boulder> That would be easiest, but we can also invoke /bin/ftp through system() if we have to
[GMT 03/08/06 17:49:00] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I'm in a shell script running Aspen anyway, so invoking ftp is no big deal.
[GMT 03/08/06 17:49:21] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> I'll send a map in a minute showing the sondes I found.
[GMT 03/08/06 18:03:09] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Image sent.
[GMT 03/08/06 18:03:13] Action: ChrisBurghart-Bishop is away: back in a few
[GMT 03/08/06 18:17:01] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Chris, FTP area created, I'll e-mail you the info
[GMT 03/08/06 18:19:05] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Mark there is a firmware update for the router, I will install it this evening or early tomorrow.
[GMT 03/08/06 18:19:16] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Cool, Brandon, I hope that helps
[GMT 03/08/06 18:19:28] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> Me too
[GMT 03/08/06 18:22:12] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Lunchtime here, back later

[GMT 03/08/06 19:24:03] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Scott's off today.  Do you know if PDFs are OK for the catalog?
[GMT 03/08/06 19:24:42] <MarkBradford-Boulder> Excellent question.  We've had PDFs in the catalog before, so it should be fine, but let me take a quick glance at the code.
