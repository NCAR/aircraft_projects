[GMT 02/24/06 22:24:43] <RonRuth-BJC> Brandon, was it you who showed me how to change my workstation's time zone via a simple keyboard command so the chatlogs will log with UTC instead of MST/MDT?  If so, can you show me again, please?  Thanks.
[GMT 02/24/06 22:45:27] <BrandonSlaten-Bishop> No, not I
[GMT 02/24/06 22:55:34] <RonRuth-BJC> OK, thanks anyway.
