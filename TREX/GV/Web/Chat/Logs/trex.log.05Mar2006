[GMT 03/05/06 22:06:51] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> That's the right form.  You probably have a small enough queue that you can do "pqcat -v > /dev/null" and look at everything in the queue to see if you can find something.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:07:34] <ChrisWebster-GV> ok, they show up in that.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:09:17] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> What feedtype do they show up with?  It should be "EXP".
[GMT 03/05/06 22:09:42] <ChrisWebster-GV> EXP
[GMT 03/05/06 22:12:24] <ChrisWebster-GV> The first one is 300KBytes and if that 4th column is the insert time, was inserted 20 minutes ago.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:13:18] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Crap.  They should be coming down with that name.  They aren't being inserted with a leading space or something funny like that, are they?
[GMT 03/05/06 22:13:59] <ChrisWebster-GV> leading 'inserted/'
[GMT 03/05/06 22:14:52] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> That would be a problem.  I'll tweak ldmd.conf here to get 'em.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:16:43] <ChrisWebster-GV> Shall I fix the script it this end for the next round.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:19:36] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> Yes.  A different prefix (like "gv_" or something like that) would be useful.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:23:13] <ScotLoehrer-Bishop> The 20 UTC MGAUS sndg.  There is an inversion just abv 600mb and another ~750mb.  Winds are SSE at low levels.  Becoming SSW by 700mb and SW abv with incr speeds.
[GMT 03/05/06 22:27:54] <ScotLoehrer-Bishop> The 20 UTC MAPR sndg.  There are inversions at ~775 and ~600 mb.  The upper inv is ~3-4C.  Winds are SSE at lower levels, quite weak between invs and increase rapidly abv upper inv out of SW.
