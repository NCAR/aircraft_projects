[GMT 03/09/06 19:47:48] <ChrisBurghart-Bishop> wasinger-GV: John, are you there?
[GMT 03/09/06 19:48:53] <Jcowan-Jeffco> Greg, I cannot look at PLWC correctly here since I'm only getting PLWC and not PLWC1 which is what it should be if it is in channel 7 if I'm correct.  My gut feeling is to run it in Ch7 all day and then we can look at it when you get back.  You could plug it into ch7 and then do a power off/on test looking for that spike and decay.  That would tell you if the wire is still good.
