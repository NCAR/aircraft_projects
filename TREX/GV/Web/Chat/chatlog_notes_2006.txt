Chat log notes -- 2006
----------------------
  compiled by Ron Ruth, rev. Wed May 24 17:20:23 GMT 2006

- Chat log for SABL logged only by workstation "berlioz" in the file:
   /net/www/docs/rdp/projects/RICO/chatlog/sabl_chatlog.txt
- Time differences below gathered mostly from the "milagro" chat room which
   was logged on both "berlioz" and the EOL chat server.
- Logs generated from "berlioz" sometimes have a time stamp offset due to
   its clock being set to London time (which observes Daylight Savings Time
   beginning on 26 March) instead of UTC.  This was fixed on 28 March.
- The chat server's clock was not synchronized to UTC until 29 March when
   NPT synchronization was enabled.  Therefore, the clock was offset by
   the amounts listed below.
